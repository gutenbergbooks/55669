</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_45_0_65 c012'>RAIN, rain, rain.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not the puny patter of a slow and
drizzling and short-lived storm, nor
the gusty petulance of an April shower, but a
steady, sullen inundation that had set in more
than a week before.</p>

<p class='c013'>For days and nights it had been nothing but
a steady downpour, and from all appearances
and barometric indications for days more it
would continue to be nothing else.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was as desolate a place and as gloomy
a season as one could imagine, and the abominable
weather was but adding to the depression
of the thousands of sturdy American
youths who for weeks had loitered in what
seemed to them a useless and nerve-racking
inactivity in a vast water-logged section of
France, west of St. Mihiel, almost south of
battle-scarred Verdun.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now and then as the hours wore on toward
late afternoon and early darkness, a rising
wind seemed to whine something of an echo
to the mental misery of those in the khaki-clad
armies thus held as on a leash. Or was
it more as a dismal-toned challenge to them
as they wallowed through the slippery mud,
unloading and distributing food, supplies,
ammunition from the seemingly never-ending
caravan of drab-colored motor trucks which
hour after hour and day after day like the
rain itself streamed in seemingly from nowhere
to the veritable swamp in which the
cream of American young manhood waded—and
waited.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom Walton, despite himself, was thinking
of Brighton and the pleasant school-days
there, as, just relieved from a monotonous
sentry duty, he headed toward the company
kitchen where he knew his good friend Harper
would hand him out a cup of steaming coffee
to warm his blood and loosen his stiffened
bones.</p>

<p class='c013'>Often with Harper, and with Ollie Ogden,
too, Tom Walton had played football on a
sometimes soggy field at Brighton, but never,
he was repeating to himself bitterly, had it
been anything like this.</p>

<p class='c013'>But pessimism or drooping spirits cannot
for long grip a lad in perfect health and
possessed of the knowledge that eventually,
soon or late, and probably at no far distant
date, he has a great mission to perform. And
so, with the first thoughts of good old Brighton,
the mood of Tom Walton began to change,
even the weather did not seem quite so dreary,
the outlook not so glum.</p>

<p class='c013'>Like many of their pals from the famous
school, these three had gone into the same
service together—fighting doughboys, if you
please—and at their own request had been
directly associated in the same unit from the
first hour that they went into training. And
it had at all times been a happy trio, for in
their days at school they had been inseparable
pals.</p>

<p class='c013'>Just at present Harper, by grace of his
culinary capabilities, was doing emergency
duty in the kitchen because of the temporary
illness of one of the regular cooks, but this
was more of an advantage than a hardship
to his two friends, as a fat sandwich or a
couple of hot doughnuts between meals often
bore substantial testimony.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom Walton was thinking of these things
when suddenly he was brought back to the
realities of life by a loudly shouted “Hi,
there!” accompanied by a clatter which
sounded like a section of the German army
advancing at a tremendous pace.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was all so sudden, the ground so treacherously
slippery, that Tom scarcely had
attempted to turn when something of tremendous
weight and momentum struck
him a glancing blow and he went sprawling
face downward in the muck, his mackinaw
canopying out over him like a miniature
dog-tent.</p>

<p class='c013'>Before he could rise and scrape enough of
the mud from his eyes to see what was going
on, three or four men went galloping by him,
one shouting warnings and futile commands,
another grunting under the stress of his labors,
a third laughing jerkily but uproariously.</p>

<p class='c013'>In shocked surprise and disgusted recognition,
Tom, rising monkey-like to all-fours,
took in the situation in a single sour glance.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had been bowled over by Maud, the
company mule!</p>

<p class='c013'>Maud, evidently, was on another privately-conducted
tour of the works—a favorite
diversion, by the way—and Maud was objecting
strenuously to any curtailment of her
pastime, especially in the shape of human
company. It was the fourth time in three
days that Maud had broken tether, and, so
to speak, pulled stakes for another part of
Europe—and always somebody got hurt.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom reflected with some satisfaction that
at least he had come off better than “Buck”
Granger, who in a pursuit of the escaped Maud
the preceding day had attempted a flying
flank attack just as Maud perceptibly increased
her speed and let fly with her heels.
Buck’s pained expression later, when the
surgeon had finished plastering and bandaging
him up, was: “The ornery cuss caved two
of my slats.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That mule will get killed some day,” Tom
muttered to himself, still scraping mud from
face and garments. “Fellow won’t stand for
this sort of stuff all the time. I believe she’s
a German spy anyway, trying to kill off
decent Americans the way she does.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And he wended his way sorely toward
Harper and the kitchen, while afar off he
could hear the continued cry of the hunt as
Maud, the incorrigible, cavorted around in
the mud, defying sentries, dodging pursuers,
having generally what Maud seemed to regard
as an all-round good time.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Any news?” he asked, as Harper handed
him the cup of hot coffee for which he had
come.</p>

<p class='c013'>Harper looked off to the northward for a
moment before he answered. Not that he
could see anything but hundreds upon hundreds
of men of all branches of the American
arms, but he seemed to be conjuring a dismal
picture in his imagination as he stood there
in silence, seeming not to have heard the
question.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, are you in a trance?” Tom demanded
impatiently.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No,” Harper answered in a peculiar tone,
“but I’m wondering just how much longer
we’re going to be kept here this way. Of
course, we shouldn’t complain or question,
but I guess we all feel the same way about it.
We’re all anxious to ‘go in,’ and I don’t
think it ought to be much longer now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What do you mean? What have you
heard?” Tom asked, excitedly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s not what I have heard, for that
hasn’t been very much. It’s what I have
seen, what you have seen, what every man
here has seen that makes me feel that the
big clash of the war is soon to come, and that
we will have a chance to be in it. The concentration
of the entire First American Army
in this sector isn’t for the purpose of giving
us a vacation, and after all I guess we can
best show our patriotism and loyalty right
now by being ready for any emergency, rather
than grumbling because Foch and Pershing
haven’t asked us out to lunch to get our opinion
on their plans.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Righto!” exclaimed Tom, with just that
emphasis upon the word which the English
Tommies had taught the Yanks.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” continued Harper, “I’m satisfied
that we are down for a big part on the program.
Look what our men have been doing
further north since June 11th, when they
captured Belleau Wood and took three hundred
prisoners.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And just review all of that and last
month. On June 19th our men crossed the
Marne, near <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Château-Thierry</span>. On June 29th
it was a raid on Montdidier. July 2nd they
captured Vaux. On the glorious 4th word
came of American success in the Vosges. A
month later Fismes was taken, and now—look
at this.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Harper liked nothing better than to spring
a surprise—a happy surprise—on his friends.
He pulled from under his blouse a late copy
of “Stars and Stripes,” the official newspaper
of the American Expeditionary forces. It
was dated September 3rd, and across the first
page, under bold, inspiring headlines, was the
stirring story of the capture of the plain of
Juvigny, north of Soissons.</p>

<p class='c013'>With nothing of boastfulness about it, it
told in vigorous language of the heroic valor
of the American troops; how, behind a creep-barrage,
they had steadily advanced until,
with a final lifting of the artillery screen, the
men, singing, shouting, cheering, advanced
into open battle with the Hun hosts.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a story to stir the blood of any
patriotic American, particularly one who was
himself under arms and only awaiting the
opportunity to perform like service in behalf
of his country and humanity.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom Walton read it to the last word before
he spoke.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I think you’re right,” he said, “it won’t
be long now until we, also, will be ‘going
in’.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What else could all this mean?” was
Harper’s way of reply. His arm swept the
whole horizon, north, westward, south, and
then up toward the east. “Haven’t you
noticed the immense numbers of the Engineering
Corps that are being brought up?
Thousands upon thousands of them.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And the truck trains,” Tom supplemented.
“Buck Granger told me last night that he
heard a captain and a lieutenant talking,
and how many of those trucks do you think
they said already are here?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t know. Couldn’t even guess. How
many?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“More than three thousand, and they’re
still coming in by scores every hour.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It means business,” Harper assented,
nodding his head vigorously. “It means
business, and on a tremendous scale. Why,
just this morning—”</p>

<p class='c013'>But just at that moment their conversation
was interrupted. Their school chum and
army pal, Ollie Ogden, burst in upon them,
wrathful to the point of pitched battle, and
at the time too breathless to speak.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Have you seen—,” he demanded, and
then gasped for another breath. “Have
you seen—.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” ventured Tom, in friendly mockery,
winking at Harper, “We’ve seen a lot. But
just what do you refer to?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“MAUD!” almost shrieked the angered
Ollie. “Have you seen that gol darned
mule?”</p>

<p class='c013'>George Harper and Tom Walton went into
gales of uncontrollable laughter. Had they
seen Maud? They sure had. Harper saw
her on her way—whither it led she refused to
say—and Tom had encountered her on the
journey.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, what are you two standing there
guffawing about?” Ollie demanded, his rage
in no way abated by the evident amusement of
his friends. “You hee-haw like that beast
itself.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This was too much for Harper, and with
his arms folded across his stomach he doubled
up like a jack knife in his mirth. But his
position was rather unfortunate. He had
his back to, and was directly in front of, the
outraged Ollie, who hauled off and gave
Harper his boot with a force that straightway
brought him upright.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look here,” he ejaculated in pained surprise.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look here!” repeated Ollie. “I’ve looked
here, I’ve looked there, I’ve looked all over
this blamed camp for that ornery offspring
of Satan. I guess you fellow’s would like to
see me get a couple of days in the guard for
letting her get away.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Could anybody ever keep her when she
made up her mind to go?” Tom asked, now
laughing as well at Harper as at Ogden.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I couldn’t, anyway, and it’s not
my fault,” Ollie asserted. “Just because a
fellow’s doing stable police he can’t be personal
valet to a beast like that all day. She—he—say,
what is a mule, anyway? A he
or a she?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A mule is what America was before
Germany tested her too far,” Harper advised
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What do you mean?” asked Ollie, with a
blank look.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Neutral.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, no. You’ve got Maud wrong. She’s
never neutral. She’s belligerent all the time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Just then there was a wild whoop of mixed
masculine voices, punctuated with a loud
hee-haw, and Ollie dashed off to join a growing
group of khaki-clad runners in pursuit of
the elusive Maud.</p>

<p class='c013'>But the mule’s present freedom was destined
for an early and ignominious end. She hadn’t
counted upon the slipperiness of the soggy
mud. She was fanning the air with her two
hind legs when the two in front went from
under. She came down suddenly upon her
side, and with a heavy grunt.</p>

<p class='c013'>In that instant two of the leaders of the
chase were upon her. The struggle that
ensued was spectacular in the extreme. The
next two men to arrive grabbed the two
fore feet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A rope, a rope!” they cried in unison, but
none dared go near, or even approach, Maud’s
rapid-fire hind legs which were kicking out
frantically in every direction.</p>

<p class='c013'>But the men hung on—two at her fore legs
and half a dozen across the body—and in a
few minutes more another breathless doughboy
arrived with the needed rope.</p>

<p class='c013'>The struggle continued, but finally Maud’s
capture was made complete. A slip-noose
was made upon her neck; half a dozen
huskies took death grips upon the other end;
the signal was given, and all at once those
who were grappling with her jumped to a
safe distance.</p>

<p class='c013'>Maud gave one disgusted glance around,
and then with a mighty effort rose to her
four feet and her full dignity. The six men
gave a quick tug at the rope around her
neck.</p>

<p class='c013'>Wow! The response was immediate and
expressive. Maud’s heels cut the air and
she made a bee-line for her captors. They
wildly scrambled to escape the onslaught, but
bravely held to the rope. The mule went
crashing by, and the slack line began to be
taken up. With a sudden jerk it became taut,
and the six men, feet outspread before them,
but unable to take a grip upon the slippery
mud, began a wild and involuntary ride in
the rear of the cavorting Maud.</p>

<p class='c013'>Across camp they took their undignified
way, as hundreds of onlookers shouted in
laughter, or made pretentious but ineffective
efforts by the vigorous waving of arms and
hats to stop the mule and the mud-bespattered
retinue that went flying in her wake. But
even Maud could not for long endure the
strangulation that the dead weight of six
men placed upon her windpipe, and so, after
having traversed fully half a mile, she came
to a halt that was as abrupt as had been the
original beginning of her flight.</p>

<p class='c013'>A strategist at all times, Maud knew by
long experience how to accept defeat and
capture. It was with a lamb-like docility
that unfailingly won her immunity from the
punishment which she so richly deserved.</p>

<p class='c013'>But even Maud’s caprice, painful as it had
been to a few, with the amusement it had
provided all the others, was forgotten a few
moments later in a rumor that ran the gamut
of the square miles of armed camp with greater
speed than the fastest mule ever could hope
to attain.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Buck” Granger, who was just wandering
from a remote spot where he had dropped off
in the pursuit, first brought the news to Tom
Walton, Ollie Ogden and Harper.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Listen!” he said, gathering them about
him as though it was some secret not yet told
to another soul. “Pershing is due to arrive
here tomorrow morning.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Pershing coming! The supreme commander
of all the American forces in Europe! “Black
Jack” Pershing, adored alike by the men
under him and those at home! Coming into
the American sector at that point! It could
mean but one thing. Their time to show their
mettle was near at hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>The rumor ran back and forth through the
vast area that the advance might be made
within the next twenty-four hours. None
could confirm it, of course. None wanted to
deny it. All were on the tip-toe of expectancy.</p>

<p class='c013'>No longer were there lingering doubts.
It was perfectly clear and assured now that
for a vast project, indeed, had all of these
great preparations been made.</p>

<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c005' />
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch02' class='c007'>CHAPTER II <br /> <br /> <span class='sc'>Ready To Go</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_6_0_65 c012'>ALTHOUGH there was scarcely an officer
who long ago had not realized the
full import and significance of the
gigantic movement which had concentrated
so many hundred thousand Americans in and
around that section opposite the German-held
St. Mihiel salient, comparatively few of the
lads in the line had looked quite so deeply
into the situation.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now it was perfectly clear.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hundreds of the biggest guns, together
with the famous French “75’s” had been
concentrated in position a few miles back.
Aeroplane squadrons had been constantly
patrolling the skies. Every branch of the
Engineers had been brought up, and now those
brave and intrepid men, the Pioneers, were
adding the final touches to the preparations
for their hazardous, self-sacrificing task.</p>

<p class='c013'>For the Pioneers, if you did not know it
before, go first of all when it is a concentrated
attack upon a well fortified and entrenched
position.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is the Pioneers who pave the way, doing
what previous artillery bombardment may
have failed to do in cutting wire entanglements,
etc.; theirs is the necessary preliminary
work, in which, much of the time, they are
open targets for the enemy fire.</p>

<p class='c013'>And then come the engineers, bridging
streams, cutting and blasting away earthen
and concrete obstructions, filling in shell
holes, levelling roads—making ready for the
great attack in which every branch of the
service on land will participate; infantry,
cavalry, light artillery, tanks, trucks, ambulances,
field hospitals, everything.</p>

<p class='c013'>These were the things for which everyone
was making ready at ten o’clock the following
morning when the first actual order was
received. It was an order which in no way
affected the men and lesser officers directly,
and yet it was one which marked the first
step in the tremendous program.</p>

<p class='c013'>Brigade, regimental and even battalion
commanders, which is to say brigadier-generals,
colonels, lieutenant-colonels and majors,
were summoned to Division Headquarters.</p>

<p class='c013'>There, as it soon became known, they met
not only the major-general in command, but
General Pershing himself. Unheralded, he had
arrived by fast auto with the break of dawn,
and since that time, as hundreds of maps
spread out before them testified, he and the
major-general had been in most important
conference.</p>

<p class='c013'>To Corporal Tom Walton fell the never-to-be-forgotten
privilege of witnessing this
historic sight.</p>

<p class='c013'>His colonel’s aide arrived back from the
conference a few moments after it had begun,
to get some maps from the colonel’s quarters.
He needed someone to help carry them over.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Corporal Walton,” his direct commander’s
voice called, “you will accompany and assist
Lieutenant Behring.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And that was how Tom Walton got his
first glimpse of the great American commander,
General Pershing. It was a close
view, too, for he had to deposit the maps and
photographs upon a table only a few feet
away from where the generals sat.</p>

<p class='c013'>In that instant, while Tom was furtively
staring at him, General Pershing looked up.
It may have been that he did not give a
thought to the youth who thus was overcome
by a sudden confusion, but Tom believed
otherwise, for the eyes seemed to twinkle
kindly for just the fraction of a second, the
square jaws relaxed just a little, and the line
of the mouth relaxed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps, on the other hand, with the biggest
job of his big career before him, General
Pershing was not unmindful of the fact that
he had behind him a whole army—thousands
upon thousands—of just such clean-cut, courageous,
never-say-die Americans as this young
man from Brighton.</p>

<p class='c013'>In a second, however, he was concentrated
again upon the problems before him, and
Tom, his job completed, was on his way back
to his comrades, to tell them over and over
again just how General Pershing looked,
spoke, acted, and a dozen other details of
information which Tom did his best to give.</p>

<p class='c013'>What actually was going on at that conference
was American and world history in
the making. It was, as it became known
later, the beginning of the end for the Boche
and for Germany.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thousands of maps and photographs were
distributed. Every foot of ground to be
traversed by every separate unit was marked
off, timed and scheduled to the whole program.
Each colonel knew to the exact moment
the time when his regiment was to go
forward from a given point of concentration;
every major knew how his battalion was to be
divided and thrust eastward under instructions
which he was to convey to his respective
captains.</p>

<p class='c013'>No war strategy ever was worked out to
finer detail. None ever attained its objective
so quickly and successfully.</p>

<p class='c013'>That afternoon, as the captains were summoned
to receive their detailed orders, the
greatest excitement prevailed everywhere.
Orders are not revealed to the men and non-commissioned
officers until the time has
arrived to carry them into effect. But there
was no longer any concealing the fact that
activities of tremendous import were imminent,
and all down the lines, as men examined
their accoutrements, the word passed and
was repeated, “We’re going in.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And finally some bright mind hit upon a
recollection, and thenceforth there was no
further doubt as to the day of the advance;
only the hour was in doubt.</p>

<p class='c013'>On September 12, 1914, the Germans, at
tremendous sacrifice in their first drive
toward Paris, had established the St. Mihiel
salient. It had been held steadily ever since,
and on this September 10, 1918, it was within
two days of that fourth anniversary. It
would be fitting punishment that the Huns
should begin to suffer retribution on the very
day when they might be expected to be feeling
as boastful as only a German can.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yes, there was no doubt about it in any
man’s mind. They were going to attack on
September 12th.</p>

<p class='c013'>And so, with this almost definite assurance
in mind, the preparations went forward with
even renewed vigor and anticipation. No
need to urge the men. They worked as boys
would for a holiday. The rain, which continued
with only slight and infrequent abatement,
was no annoyance, was hardly even
noticed now.</p>

<p class='c013'>The big work for which they had prepared
for months—first in America, then in England,
and finally behind the lines in France—was
now at hand. Their mettle was to be tested
against the Boche. Their numbers, their
ability, their courage were to be thrown into
the world contest of Liberty against Autocracy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you remember how you used to feel
just before we went into a game against an
eleven that we knew to be at least our own
weight?” Ollie breathed to Tom and George,
as the three of them were completing the last
essentials to a critical inspection.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure do,” replied Tom, the biggest and
heaviest of the three, “and I never put on
a head-piece with greater anticipation than I
do this,” and he clamped his heavy helmet
on as though the battle already were under
way.</p>

<p class='c013'>In a muffled voice Harper wanted to know
how his gas mask became him, and if really,
after all, he wasn’t the long-sought missing
link.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is a cheerfulness about men about
to go into battle that only those who have
been through it can understand—a thrilling
of every nerve that makes one jest, even
though death may be stalking only a few
yards or a few hours ahead—a forgetfulness
of all else but the determined will to fight to
the last, and to win.</p>

<p class='c013'>Suddenly from far to the east there came
the muffled thunder of heavy cannonading
which brought all three men upright. For a
moment they thought that real hostilities
were on; but the illusion was not for long.
The sporadic reply of their own batteries told
them as clearly as words could that it was
just “one of those messages from Fritz and
Heinie” which of course required a reply,
but did not after all amount to very much.
It was a sort of exchange of compliments,
the lads in the trenches termed it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nevertheless every man was on edge, and
when a simultaneous shout of warning and
expectancy went up from two or three alert
fellows who had been gazing skyward, a
thousand heads went up, to witness one of
those most daring and spectacular exhibitions
of the entire war—a battle in the air.</p>

<p class='c013'>The three Brighton boys—for as such they
were known to all their companions—rushed
for an elevation already occupied by half a
dozen others, and from which a wider sweep
of the skyline was to be had.</p>

<p class='c013'>Even as they did so the real preliminaries
to the battle began. The American pilot,
who it was now plain had been merely playing
the role of the pursued to lead the enemy
beyond the aid of any of his own machines,
suddenly swerved for the attack.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Boche pilot was in a small and speedy
Albatross, but in maneuvres and tactics he
was outmatched by the American, who came
at him with such speed and directness that
the witnesses, a thousand feet below, held
their breath in expectation of a crash that
would bring both machines and their pilots
to the ground a battered, mangled mass.</p>

<p class='c013'>But the American pilot knew his game well.
He swerved a little upward and over, just as
the Hun took a swift nose dive to avoid contact.
There was the rat-tat-tat of machine
gun fire, that sounded from the distance more
like the popping of toy guns. Neither made
a hit, apparently, but the American plane had
the position in which the Boche had to pass
under, over or around him in any attempt to
reach his own lines.</p>

<p class='c013'>The German had no heart for battle and
headed straight south. Again the American
came at him like a streak of lightning, began
to climb at the same time, and the enemy
tried a downward sweep and a turn northward
at the same time. The American turned, too,
and those on the ground began to applaud at
the advantage he had gained. He was but a
relatively short distance behind, but at a
much higher altitude.</p>

<p class='c013'>As the Hun headed northeastward with all
the speed he could get out of his Albatross,
the American came down the wind, dropping
as he came, and with momentum adding to
the power of his propeller. When just within
range he opened up with a fusilade from his
machine gun. The German tried swiftly to
change his course, but the effort was made
too late.</p>

<p class='c013'>His plane was seen to hover for a moment
first on one wing and then the other, as it
seemed to come to a dead halt, and then, just
as a little tongue of flame shot outward
there was a loud explosion, the Albatross
turned its nose downward and crashed to
earth.</p>

<p class='c013'>The American machine circled for a moment,
as though the pilot were seeking his
exact bearings, and then began a long, slow,
gliding descent.</p>

<p class='c013'>From all directions men by the score hurried
over to where the machine would land, learn
the identity and get a glimpse of the pilot
who had furnished the entertainment.</p>

<p class='c013'>As he came to the ground, the plane halted
and the first of them gathered around, there
was a gasp of astonishment and sympathy,
the pilot lay back in his seat as white as a
ghost, his left arm hung limp at his side,
blood trickled from a wound in his shoulder,
and obviously he would have fainted and fallen
had the battle lasted a few moments longer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A stretcher!” cried a lieutenant of the
Aviation Corps, who had run to the spot to
congratulate his colleague.</p>

<p class='c013'>A stretcher was brought, and an ambulance
came hurrying up. The man was unconscious
when he was lifted in.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Serious, but not fatal,” was the abrupt
diagnosis of a surgeon after a cursory examination.
“Mostly weakness from loss of
blood.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But why did he stay up after being hit?”
asked one man, more of himself than anyone
else.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Hun would have been glad to get
away at any time,” put in another.</p>

<p class='c013'>The lieutenant who had called for the
stretcher turned in no unfriendly way toward
them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He didn’t come down until he’d gotten
his objective,” he said, “because of the stuff
that he’s got in him—the same stuff that you
fellows have got, too. You’ll be doing the
same and just as good things on land, once
you get started—and that won’t be very
long now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He added the last few words in more of
an undertone, as though speaking to himself,
but everyone caught the significance of them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I believe it’s a good sign,” said Ollie
Ogden, as the three friends were slushing
over the still slippery return journey, although
the long rain had ceased early that
morning.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Believe what’s a good sign?” demanded
Harper, impatient that Ollie should be so
indirect.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The way that pilot stayed up and won his
fight.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, how’s that a sign? A sign of what?”
Tom broke in.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why,” explained Ollie, “I believe it’s a
sort of a forecast of this new drive we’re
going into, and for that matter the whole
war. Some of us may and will get hurt,
but we’re going to stick at it until we win,
and we’re going to make the quickest possible
job of it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bravo!” exclaimed Tom, “Only in our
case we’re not going to invite the enemy
over our lines to do it. We’re going to carry
the fight to him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’re right,” added Harper, “and this
looks as if it’s not many hours off.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He pointed to a long string of motor trucks
bearing pioneers, engineers, snipers, wire-cutters—the
forerunners of a battle in which
preliminary difficulties must be overcome.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom looked at his wrist watch. It was
6.16 and the sun was just setting. Darkness
would soon enclose that part of France in
the cloak of night—and it was upon the eve
of the fourth anniversary of German-established
St. Mihiel saliant!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not long is right,” he said, reminiscently.</p>

<p class='c013'>And Harper added, while Ollie nodded his
head in assent:</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll soon be ready to go.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch03' class='c007'>CHAPTER III <br /> <br /> <span class='sc'>The Silent Call to Battle</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_6_0_65 c012'>AT nine o’clock that night the order
came. Or rather, it better be said,
that it was nine o’clock, the appointed
hour, when the top sergeants silently
formed their men, reported to lieutenants,
who in turn relayed the statements to captains,
who passed them to majors, and thus
to the colonels and the brigadier generals.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not a word as to their destination; as few
spoken orders as possible; very few lights.</p>

<p class='c013'>The very air seemed to tingle with the
mystery of it as Tom and George and Ollie
fell into their places in the first platoon of
Company C.</p>

<p class='c013'>Company after company strode away until
entire regiments were on the move. It was
ten-thirty when Company C entered the
march.</p>

<p class='c013'>So far as the boys could determine, their
direction was northeast, which was calculated
to bring them in direct contact with the
entrenched Germans holding the southern
leg of the St. Mihiel salient.</p>

<p class='c013'>They had gone perhaps two miles, their
own platoon somewhat separated now from
the rest of the company as each unit took
its own particular divergent route, when the
lieutenant, Gaston by name, halted them for
a moment while he consulted his wrist watch,
and then, more guardedly, a map and the
landscape thereabouts.</p>

<p class='c013'>Those men would have gone anywhere for
Gaston. He was one of those born leaders
of men, but what was more, he was always
willing to go where he would ask another man
to take a risk. The men knew that, and as a
result there was no finer morale in any platoon
in the whole American army, which was saying
a great deal.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’re a trifle behind schedule,” he announced
in a quiet voice. “We’ll hustle up a
bit as we go down this incline.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And setting the pace himself, they dogtrotted
for the next half mile. Then a second
stop was made, and as the men under him
watched his countenance by the brief glare
of his pocket searchlight they knew that
they had made up their lost time, and were
now at the point where the program scheduled
them to be at that particular moment.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hardly a word was spoken. If one man
wanted to speak to his “bunkie,” he first
gave him a slight nudge on the arm or in the
ribs, and then leaned over close to whisper
whatever it was he had to say.</p>

<p class='c013'>Heavy clouds obscured the stars. It was a
pitch black night. But despite that, there
were few accidents, although a few of the lads
stumbled and went to the ground, only to
rise and adjust themselves without a word.</p>

<p class='c013'>They passed through a thick wood, but the
engineers had been before them, and there
was at least the semblance of a broad path,
now well beaten down by the hundreds of
their fellow men who had passed through
before them during the last two hours.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once a felled tree which had not entirely
flattened to the ground, broke off at the stump
with a sharp crack and crunching sound. On
the instant every man was flat on the soggy
earth, listening, intent, ready for a surprise
attack or any emergency.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Tom recognized the voice of his own
captain, fifty feet on the other side of it,
instructing the men as to the route of their
passage, and in a moment more they were
again on their way.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were coming now into the area of the
furthest obstacles and entanglements that
had been thrown out by the Germans, and
as they swung into a broad and fairly level
road, the piles of barbed wire along its sides
testified to the rapid, but efficient work of
the wire-cutters who had been there for
two preceding nights unobserved, and were
even now but a short distance ahead, paving
the way with the pioneers for the great hosts
of infantry and tanks that soon were to attack
the enemy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lively now, men,” Lieutenant Gaston
instructed as they came upon this highway;
and again they swung into a trot, after ten
minutes of which, as though it had all been
done by clock work, they closed in with the
balance of Company C.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If an enemy flare goes up, each man into
the gutter along the roadside without a
second’s hesitation,” Captain McCallum ordered.
“And no noise from now on.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was as though he had said to them:
“A few hundred yards ahead are the enemy
outposts, with sentries listening for the slightest
warning.” And indeed that was true.</p>

<p class='c013'>They entered a rocky, shell-torn, treacherous
field, where even the art and energy of
the Engineers had failed entirely to fill all
the pits or level all the mounds thrown up by
the powerful projectiles which the Boches
had directed there.</p>

<p class='c013'>The pace slackened, to avert accident or
discovery, and the men literally crawled along,
their unit only kept intact by each man keeping
in touch with those on either side of him.</p>

<p class='c013'>Their baptism of fire came while crossing
this vast stretch of open ground. They were
on their final lap of the march to the communication
trenches when there was a roar from
behind the German lines and a big shell
broke almost directly in front of Company D.</p>

<p class='c013'>By the spasm of light that accompanied the
explosion the boys from Brighton saw at
least half a dozen of D company men go
down. Whether they were killed, wounded or
merely thrown to the ground by the force of
the shock they did not learn until later. But
it proved that three men had been killed outright,
two others fatally and a third slightly
injured.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom and Ollie shuddered as Harper whispered
the names, as they had been passed
along from man to man. One of the killed
was Henry Turner, as fine a fellow as ever
breathed, as Tom himself learned when they
had played guard positions opposite each
other on opposing boarding school football
teams.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Too bad,” Ollie muttered. “Lots worse
that could be better spared.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They were halted here for nearly ten
minutes, the officers waiting for any further
evidence that the enemy was aware of their
movement, but apparently it was but a
chance shot, for no other followed it. They
resumed the advance, but even more cautiously
than before.</p>

<p class='c013'>They could sense rather than see now that
before and about them on either side were
thousands upon thousands of their own men,
coming up in separate companies, becoming
battalions and these in turn regiments, until
whole brigades and entire divisions lay
stretched along the line, waiting for the
opening of the tremendous artillery bombardment
and barrage that was to screen
their final advance into the enemy’s lines.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was as Company C was entering the
second line trenches from a tramway that an
incident occurred that caused both mirth
and many a heart pang.</p>

<p class='c013'>The leading men in the first platoon came
to a sudden halt and for no apparent reason
did not immediately take up progress. There
was grumbling and growling, punctuated by
sounds of suppressed mirth. When the delay
had lengthened into minutes, and couriers
had arrived from the commanders of both D
and E companies, bearing their respects and
asking if the line would not move on, Captain
McCallum himself pressed impatiently forward
to determine the cause of the hold-up.</p>

<p class='c013'>He found the men in the lead maintaining
a respectful distance from the rear end of an
army mule that stood, with head down,
ready to kick out at any moment, and effectively
blocking the passageway.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Buck” Granger, who was in the lead,
informed the captain that the animal was
adamant to all coaxing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“See if you can slide by,” Captain McCallum
ordered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Buck” tried it. He was about midships
of the mule when it suddenly leaned over
against him. He was caught as though in a
trap.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, gosh,” he panted in misery.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the matter now?” the captain
demanded.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing,” Granger answered with what
breath he had left, “only it’s Maud, and she’s
got me fast, paying up back debts.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Three or four of you huskies try to lift her
out of the trench,” the officer then ordered,
and as the designated number applied their
strength to trying to budge the mule upward,
half a dozen others clambered out of
the trench to lend a helping hand from above.</p>

<p class='c013'>But it was a useless effort. Not only were
the men risking their life in futile efforts to
raise the heavy beast, but the men above
leaned over and whispered to the captain,
“No use, there’s a high wire fence on either
side.”</p>

<p class='c013'>By this time the Germans—apparently
without any knowledge of the movement
beyond their lines, however—were letting go
occasional shells.</p>

<p class='c013'>“With the next blast from Fritz, shoot the
beast,” Captain McCallum ordered; for not
only were his own men being delayed, but
all of those who followed. The entire program
might fall with the failure of the required
regiments to be at their appointed place
when the opening of the artillery signalled the
forward movement behind a curtain of shells.</p>

<p class='c013'>How Maud got there no one in the entire
regiment could have told. It was like Maud—German
spy, Tom had called her—to be
forever upsetting law and order and the
best-laid plans. She was interfering now
with the movement of a large part of an
American army, and yet the lads who had
known and loved the beast despite its unruly
disposition felt much as though a personal
friend thus was to be put forever out of the
way.</p>

<p class='c013'>A corporal who had mounted the trench
side to try and help lift Maud out, jumped
down in front of her and placed his pistol at
her head.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And be careful not to hit Granger,” was
the captain’s final warning, as he again
noticed “Buck,” still in the vice-like grip
and rapidly being crushed breathless.</p>

<p class='c013'>The corporal pointed his pistol in such a
way that the bullet could not endanger
“Buck;” a German gun went off and simultaneously
with it there was a flash at Maud’s
head, her whole body quivered for an instant,
and then she went down in a heap.</p>

<p class='c013'>The hundreds upon hundreds of men who
followed those of Company C through that
trench, stepped upon something big and
bulky and soft, but none knew until later
that it was the dead body of what had been
one of the most cantankerous mules in the
American army.</p>

<p class='c013'>How the word came none knew, but nevertheless
the various regiments hardly had
taken up their appointed places before it
became whispered from man to man that
simultaneously with the American attack
upon the southern wing of the St. Mihiel
salient, the French were to launch an equally
vigorous attack from the north.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was satisfying information, or prediction,
although the Americans, needless to
say, required nothing to sharpen their enthusiasm,
nothing to bolster up a courage
which was prone at times even to sweep away
discretion and better judgment and carry
them into unnecessary hazards.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nevertheless, it was good news to know
that the poilus were “going in,” too—that
it was to be a strike-together battle for quick
and indisputable supremacy.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not known until later how true the
information was, but the German high command
would have paid a fat price to have
been apprised of it; for not only was it
exactly what did happen, but had the Boches
known of the plan undoubtedly they would
have been able to put up a stouter defense,
even though it was bound to crumble in the
end under such terrific attacks as Foch and
Pershing launched against the armies which
for four years had lain impregnable in that
bulging line, a menace to the Allies in any
forward movement that the Huns might be
able to put under way.</p>

<p class='c013'>The marvel of it all, though, to the men
who entered the trenches that night, was the
completeness and the readiness of the preparations
for the opening of the battle they were
to make.</p>

<p class='c013'>When you, who read this, stop to think how
long a distance 5,000 miles is, and then consider
that just that amount of telephone
wire, 5,000 miles, had been laid and connected
for keeping every unit and the various
commanding quarters in complete touch with
every advance, every development, every
emergency or contingency, you may realize,
too, that these Americans were being sent in
only after the most careful planning, and
after every precaution of whatever nature
had been taken to insure success. It was no
haphazard undertaking, there was no reliance
upon luck or chance. It was a scientific
operation, computed and arranged to the last
detail.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not only that, but more than 100,000
detail maps and 40,000 photographs were
prepared, largely from aerial observations,
and distributed to the officers in charge of
carrying the operation forward. These maps
and photographs showed practically every
foot of ground to be traversed, every natural
and artificial defense which they would be
called upon to conquer, and put upon paper
even more clearly than words could have
expressed it the exact route and objective of
every single company and platoon that was
engaged in the fight.</p>

<p class='c013'>And in addition to that, as the men of the
regiment to which our friends were attached
lay down upon their arms that night, awaiting
the outbreak of the artillery onslaught
which would indicate that the first phase of
the battle was on, 10,000 men sat at the
various instruments connected up to the
improvised telephone system, and 3,000 carrier
pigeons were being distributed among
different units, to be released when their
objectives had been obtained, or insurmountable
difficulties were encountered—provided
word could not be gotten back to headquarters
by any other means.</p>

<p class='c013'>Captain McCallum looked at his wrist
watch, and then at a paper he held in his
hand. He went down the trench repeating
the information which was the first thing
definite that the men had learned since they
started for the front.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Our army is attacking along a twelve-mile
front,” he said. “Our own immediate
objective for tomorrow will be Thiaucourt.
I need not tell you more. That is our objective.
It means that we must take that town.
Pershing has placed his trust in you for that;
so, also, has Marshal Foch. We are at about
the centre of the line driving upon that
point.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And without further word he passed along
to another group, to which he issued the
same information and instruction.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thiaucourt,” repeated Tom, as the captain
left. “Never heard of it before, but I
guess it’s got to be ours by tomorrow night.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Righto!” assented Harper and Ollie together.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch04' class='c007'>CHAPTER IV <br /> <br /> <span class='sc'>The Thunder of Mars</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c012'>NEVER has there been such a sudden
and simultaneous crashing outburst
of artillery of every conceivable kind
and calibre as ripped the darkness and the
silence at two-thirty o’clock on the morning
of September 12th on the southern side of
the St. Mihiel salient.</p>

<p class='c013'>For the five minutes preceding the appointed
time every officer of the staff and
line had stood gazing at his wrist watch,
counting off the seconds, knowing what was
coming, waiting for it, wishing for it, and
yet withal unprepared for the terrible shock
which seemed to make the very earth rock
and roar.</p>

<p class='c013'>With such an uninterrupted banging and
booming and screeching and swishing as
never before had been heard upon the face
of the earth, thousands upon thousands of
guns, massed side by side along a line twelve
miles long, were belching forth as in one
thunderous voice a new and world wide
Declaration of Independence.</p>

<p class='c013'>America, come to another continent to
avenge mankind and save humanity and
civilization, was pouring the wrath of the
universe into the Hun lines and defenses.</p>

<p class='c013'>Under the terrific shock of the thing men
fell upon their faces in the trenches, their
hands to their ears in a vain effort to shut
out the screaming, nerve-racking death-cry
of the cannon. The attempts were futile.
Never for an instant did the guns pause;
never was there the slightest break in their
awful rhythm.</p>

<p class='c013'>Men in the trenches whose duty still lay
before them, marveled at the strength and
endurance, the proficiency and the tenacity
of those other men, far behind the lines, who
were feeding, feeding, feeding shells into the
maw of this tremendous array of artillery.</p>

<p class='c013'>A veritable cloud of projectiles—death-dealing,
trench-destroying shells—were being
hurled over the heads of the infantrymen into
the long-held defenses of the Boche.</p>

<p class='c013'>And then, as if that was not enough for
men to endure, just before they were to throw
their own lives into the battle, the German
guns began to reply.</p>

<p class='c013'>They had no range, for the attack was a
complete surprise. Had they been less self-complacent
they might have realized that for
days before, when an invincible fleet of
aeroplanes of every description had kept their
own air observers from flying over this area,
something of great significance was under
way.</p>

<p class='c013'>But if they sensed it, their efforts to learn
were of no avail, and so when the awful
thunder of shelling began, they could only
guess where the infantry and tanks were
massed, which inevitably would follow in
the wake of the artillery carnage.</p>

<p class='c013'>So, when they opened up, terrifically, too,
it is true, but with nothing like the force of
the assault directed against them, it was
with a sweeping shelling much like the playing
of a searchlight over an area. It was not
a barrage; it was more like the blind, helpless
and hysterical hitting back of one who
knows not where his opponent is.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nevertheless shells fell dangerously near;
and once a big one landed directly in the
second line trenches, less than a hundred
yards below where Company C was stationed.
Its toll of death was appalling. A dozen
men were blown to atoms. Rocks that had
been part of the trench formation were thrown
in all directions, dealing death and injury as
surely as the explosive itself.</p>

<p class='c013'>The inadvertent first cry of a dozen injured
men was enough to shake the nerves of
the strongest; for after all in warfare, it is
not so much the risking, or even the giving,
of one’s life, as it is the agonized suffering
of others dying that makes a man quake,
and for the moment falter.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom leaned over toward Harper and tried
to shout something in his ear, but the effort
was as useless as though the one had been
dumb and the other deaf. It was absolutely
impossible to make the human voice heard.
When an officer wished to issue some brief
order, it was only by signs that he could
make himself understood.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hour after hour it continued without the
slightest halt.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom Walton began to wonder how much
longer it would continue—how much longer
such an earth-shaking onslaught <i>could</i> continue.
Men who have gone through it know
that the strain of such a thing, the absolutely
inactive and helpless waiting, is the worst
mental torture of all warfare, and far worse
than rushing forth into battle which may
mean almost certain death.</p>

<p class='c013'>For a time thought seems to be suspended,
and there is nothing but the frightful burst of
explosions, during which one cannot think.
And then comes a period of dulled senses—dulled
to the present, and taking one into
the past.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is not like the mental sensations of a
drowning man, in which the entire past life
flashes before the mind in a clear but lightning-like
panorama; but rather one takes
up separate events, finds himself analyzing
them for causes, motives; and, try to shake
himself together as he will, cannot for the
time rid himself of the melancholy fascination
of it.</p>

<p class='c013'>So it was with Tom Walton—perhaps also
with Ollie Ogden and George Harper.</p>

<p class='c013'>Men were not cowards who broke down
and wept during that awful night. They
were not afraid of bodily injury or death.
It was the terrible strain upon nerves already
strung taut with preparation for, and in
anticipation of, the battle which they must
fight and win. The very restraint which for
the time curbed the fulfillment of their determination
was the severest sort of sap upon
their vitality.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom wondered at his own impersonal and
disinterested detachment as he stood watching
a man of his own company wringing his
hands, unable to repress his feelings, the tears
rolling down his cheeks. He had known the
fellow intimately for months. Twice he had
seen him risk his life to aid a comrade. He
gazed at him now, but his own feelings were
calloused to the other’s misery.</p>

<p class='c013'>His own thoughts, strangely enough, were
not of the present nor of the task so near at
hand, but of his school days. And of all
the incidents that crossed his mind, one stood
out with particular insistence. It was shortly
before he had entered Brighton, and when
his mother, dear soul, was skimping herself
of everything she could (as he knew now) to
give him the education which she realized
would be his asset later.</p>

<p class='c013'>The day stood out before his distorted
mind now as a great blot upon his whole
career. He shuddered as he thought of it,
and yet he could not turn his mind to other
things. He reviewed it again and again.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had started for school as usual that
morning, but on his way had met companions.
They, too, were pupils in the same school,
but it was the late springtime of the year,
and they were going to try the old swimming
hole. At first Tom refused to join them, but
finally the temptation became too great.</p>

<p class='c013'>He joined them in their truancy, and they
started for what they planned to be a rollicking
day. On their way they invaded an
apple orchard and pulled branch after branch
of the blossoms that, left to grow, would
have become ripe and useful fruit. Tom’s
mother hardly would have believed that he
would deliberately stay away from school,
much less go swimming at that season when
she had warned him that illness inevitably
would be the result. But he had done both.
And on their way home one of the lads, who
had a sling-shot, had killed a chirping robin.
It was probably that last act of heartlessness
that showed Tom the exact character of the
companions he had chosen for his day of
deception.</p>

<p class='c013'>That night he had had a chill, and for days
his mother had nursed him through a sickness
for which she could not account. And he
had never told her. A feeling of revulsion
and shame overcame him. For the time he
even forgot the thousands of shells that were
being hurled over his head. He wondered if
in this battle he would be killed. A great
longing came over him to see his mother,
and in the old spirit of boyhood confidence
to tell her the whole story. Yes, if he should
live, he would tell her at the first opportunity.
He did not want anyone else to have the
chance to tell her first.</p>

<p class='c013'>And with the good resolution came mental
relief. He seemed to come back to himself
again, and looking about him began to
speculate as to what sort of thoughts were
passing through the minds of the men about
him. From one to another he looked, wondering
what confessions, if any, they would
make if they could.</p>

<p class='c013'>But in such an inferno as that neither
introspection nor retrospection can last very
long, and it was the nearby explosion of a
heavy German shell, sending a shower of
steel and rock fragments into the trench, that
brought Tom Walton to a keen realization
of the present. A piece of metal plate nearly
circular in shape, fully three inches in diameter,
and most peculiarly scrolled by the
forces that had blown it from the shell, fell
directly at his feet. He picked it up, examined
it for a moment, and then dropped
it into his blouse pocket as a souvenir of
his first night under such a cannonading.</p>

<p class='c013'>A lieutenant tapped him on the shoulder,
and he swung around as though shot. The
officer smiled grimly an instant and thrust
before Tom a sheet of paper on which was a
brief instruction which could not be given
verbally because of the din:</p>

<p class='c013'>“We go over in forty-five minutes. Be
ready when the artillery lets up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom nodded and the lieutenant passed to
Ollie and George Harper, and so on from
man to man along the entire section of
trench occupied by Company C.</p>

<p class='c013'>In forty-five minutes! The time was getting
close. Well, anything was better than
remaining there motionless under such a
strain, not knowing at what moment a Boche
shell might come thundering into their shallow
stopping place to spread sudden death and
mortal injury.</p>

<p class='c013'>Men began tightening and adjusting their
equipment, examining their rifles, cartridge
belts and small arms.</p>

<p class='c013'>A Salvation Army man came down the
trench lugging a great can of steaming coffee.
The boys of Company C greeted him with
cheers which their lips formed but their
voices could not make heard; and as they
took cautious quaffs of the hot beverage it
seemed to soothe ragged nerves and give
them new vigor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom looked at his wrist watch and compared
it with Harper’s. They were exactly
the same time. But half an hour now remained.</p>

<p class='c013'>That instant marked another move in the
game, too. In little groups men climbed out
of the trench and went forward. Tom knew
instinctively that they were the dare-devil
wire-cutters—that the American artillery, adjusted
like clockwork, had moved forward
and these men were going out to cut away
any entanglements that it had not smashed
and entirely destroyed.</p>

<p class='c013'>In this conflict war had become an exact
science, and the men going out knew that
except for an occasional German shell that
might fall in their vicinity they were working
behind an invincible screen of steel and fire.</p>

<p class='c013'>There flashed across Tom Walton’s mind
the picture of General Pershing as he had
seen him on the preceding day in conference
with the officers who were to direct and carry
out the gigantic project which he and the
other great commanders had formulated;
and in the recollection Tom found new
confidence and determination. Whatever indecision
may have possessed him fell away;
it was as though he suddenly had been shorn
of shackles which weighted him down; he
breathed in deeply of the powder-tainted air,
and his only sensation was that of a great and
noble strength of purpose.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom examined his watch again. But ten
minutes more!</p>

<p class='c013'>Suddenly, almost with as great a shock as
it had begun, the firing ceased. If the expression
can be made, the tremendous silence
that fell upon the area came like a crash.
For the men had become gradually tuned up
to the dreadful uproar, and to have it abruptly
break off set their heads ringing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get ready, boys!” Captain McCallum’s
perfectly controlled voice spoke out down
the trench, and the lads could hear other
captains giving like orders to their own men.</p>

<p class='c013'>And then the artillery began again, but it
was more subdued than before. Tom looked
upward and realized that the first streaks of
dawn were stretching out across the sky.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was immediately aware of something
else, also. The smoke screen was being laid
down!</p>

<p class='c013'>This was the final of the preliminary moves
to their “going over.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It began only a few yards out from the
trench line and gradually moved off toward
where the enemy had been undergoing such
terrific punishment.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lieutenant Gaston was alternating his attention
upon the smoke screen and his watch.
Tom looked at his own timepiece. It was
5.25 on the morning of September 12, 1918,
four years to a day since the Germans had
established the St. Mihiel salient!</p>

<p class='c013'>Men were readjusting their steel helmets
or tugging impatiently at uniform and equipment.</p>

<p class='c013'>Captain McCallum raised his right arm
and the men as best they could in their
cramped quarters came to attention.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thiaucourt!” the commander shouted.</p>

<p class='c013'>A great cheer came from every throat.
It was taken up and echoed by companies
on their right and on their left.</p>

<p class='c013'>The captain again raised his right hand.
His eyes were on his watch. The second
hand was ticking round to 5.30.</p>

<p class='c013'>The men stood with outstretched hands
grasping the wall of the trench in front of
them to leap up and out.</p>

<p class='c013'>Abruptly the captain’s hand fell. “Let’s
go.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And with a wild shout of exultation men of
that company, and men of other companies on
either side, miles up and down the trench,
were up and over, in pursuit of the smoke
screen—and the Hun.</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_45_0_65 c012'>SHOCK troops are all that the name itself
implies. They are the troops sent forward,
in human waves, to receive and
break the first shock of contact with the
enemy lines. Invariably a large number of
them are doomed to death or injury, and the
men themselves know it. But the very
knowledge seems to drive them forward with
greater fury, and the clash, therefore, is one
of carnage for one or both sides.</p>

<p class='c013'>These were the shock troops that were
going over with the dawn against the entrenched
Germans—if they still remained
entrenched after the terrible fire to which
they had been subjected for hours by the
massed American artillery, augmented by the
world-known French 75’s.</p>

<p class='c013'>Even through the rolling smoke screen the
light was becoming stronger, and Tom, Ollie
and Harper, plodding ahead rapidly with
their comrades, knew that soon it would be
full dawn, that the screen would be lifted,
and behind a barrage of fire that still would
precede them for a short distance, the infantry
would come to position to launch its
close-range avalanche of rifle and machine
gun bullets upon the enemy.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was just as they were beginning to
quicken the pace that Tom heard a grunt
and a gasp, followed by a muttered word or
two, and looking down upon his left side
saw Ollie, almost up to his neck in a huge
hole dug by one of the shells with which the
Boche had made futile effort to stop the
American fire.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom on one side and George Harper on
the other, they managed to haul Ollie out,
but the sudden drop had jarred him to the
point of nausea and for several yards, as they
double-quicked it to catch up with their line,
they virtually carried their chum along, each
of them holding to one of his arms.</p>

<p class='c013'>Looking skyward Tom made another discovery.
It was as though great flocks of
giant birds peopled the air. Aeroplanes of
every capacity and description and in various
formations were maneuvering over their
heads and beyond them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Watching them as he trotted along, Tom
saw from time to time a smaller scout plane
separate itself from its group and dart forward
and out of sight over the enemy lines.
Presently it would return, sometimes to remain
with its squadron, at others to continue
back to some signalling point in the rear,
from which it relayed the facts of the German’s
position or movements.</p>

<p class='c013'>Massive battle and bombing planes plowed
along, their powerful motors beating a tremendous
bass throb as their big propellers
churned the air.</p>

<p class='c013'>Here and there, too, were anchored observation
baloons, the observers in them,
equipped with parachutes for a long jump
to safety at any time, sitting at telephone
instruments connected with the various headquarters.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the land and in the sky the battle was
on—the history-making battle of the St.
Mihiel salient!</p>

<p class='c013'>Once a German aero battle fleet that a
few months before would have been considered
the most formidable fighting unit that
ever took the air, sailed forward as if to
engage the American gunners and pilots in a
struggle; but either their courage failed them
or better judgment prevailed, for there was a
quick signal from the leader of the group,
and with greater speed than they had approached
they turned and fled toward their
own lines.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Fritz isn’t feeling very well this morning,”
the irrepressible “Buck” Granger shouted,
and a merry shout arose from the men who
were within hearing of the remark.</p>

<p class='c013'>And, indeed, it seemed to be the truth.
Fritz was getting some of his own medicine,
and apparently he considered it a rather
bitter dose.</p>

<p class='c013'>The smoke ahead began to dissipate itself
in the brisk early morning breeze, and the
men had their first realization that the firing
behind them had almost ceased.</p>

<p class='c013'>In subdued voices the officers were now
counselling their men to use all reasonable
precaution; and indeed the orders were
necessary, for the lads, now this far upon
their errand of victory, were ready to plunge
ahead, regardless of all hazards.</p>

<p class='c013'>And then in another instant the whole
thing was on. Tom did not hear the order
given. As he thought the thing over afterward,
he wondered if any actual order had
been uttered. It was a matter of doubt, not
only with himself, but with many other of
the men. But after all that was a matter of
only secondary moment.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were in—those men in the first wave
of shock companies—and now they were
racing like mad toward where the enemy lay
waiting.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were within fifty yards of the wood
which was their immediate objective when
they suddenly were made aware that it was
a veritable wasp’s nest of hidden machine
guns. With disconcerting unison they began
to spit their bullets at the American lines,
and the men, trained to just such a contingency,
fell flat upon their stomachs with
such alacrity that none could tell which or
how many had been killed or wounded by
this first defense of the hidden Huns.</p>

<p class='c013'>The machine guns continued their murderous
sput-sput-sput, but the range was
over the heads of the men as they stealthily
edged forward, now in scattered, zig-zag line.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom saw George Harper train his gun
upon the thick foliage of a near tree, and,
almost on the instant that he fired, a huge
German came toppling through the branches
and to the ground.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Number one,” Harper muttered, with set
jaw. But another sharp-shooter had picked
him out, and he had hardly said the words
when a bullet flattened itself against his
helmet with such force as to drive it down
over his eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>A sergeant crawled past where Tom and
Ollie were scraping their way forward. “I
want three men to go with me to get that
nearest machine gun nest,” he whispered,
“you two come along.”</p>

<p class='c013'>As Tom and Ollie followed as cautiously
as they could, they realized that the third
man was their old friend, “Buck” Granger.
“A little action at last,” he grumbled, good-naturedly,
as he wiped from his eye a chunk
of dirt that had been thrown up by a bullet
which plowed into the ground less than a
foot ahead of him. “This is the real stuff.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The sergeant warned them to be careful
not to raise their voices. They were making
their way through a patch of tall weeds and
grass, and the object was to move as rapidly
as possible, and yet with every caution, so
that they might overtake the nest without
themselves being discovered.</p>

<p class='c013'>Further to the left of them some of their
own men already had risen again and were
rushing toward the wood. This particular
gun was trained upon them, and Tom gritted
his teeth in silent resolution of revenge as
he saw it send forth its hail of bullets, mowing
down three Americans, painfully if not
mortally wounded.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were within fifteen yards of the spot
when the tallest of the four Germans visible
discovered them approaching. He muttered
some gutteral sound of warning to his companions,
but it was his last word, for the
sergeant picked him off with a clean shot
through the heart.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='sc'>Ollie Hurled a Grenade Directly Into the Group That Remained.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Hardly had the sergeant’s rifle spoken when
Ollie, with the strength and aim he had gained
on many a long throw straight from second
base to the home plate in many a hard-fought
baseball game, hurled a grenade directly into
the group that remained. As the smoke
cleared, Tom was at the gun, swung it about
and turned it full upon a clump of bushes
from which another batch of Boches were
attempting to stop or stem the irresistible tide
of American oncomers.</p>

<p class='c013'>They attempted to surrender, but as
through a trumpet Tom heard the shouted
order of a major, “On, on! No quarter!”
And with what had been their own weapon
a few moments before, another half dozen
of the enemy went to their Judgment.</p>

<p class='c013'>Far ahead of them German guns were
hurling shells at the point where the fight
was becoming thickest, but for the time their
range was sufficiently short to be inflicting
more damage upon their own troops than
upon the Americans. The battle was now
becoming hotter with each moment, for while
the first wave of shock troops was going
forward with unconquerable valor, the Germans
who were on the very rear of a vast
retreating host were stubbornly contesting
each foot of the way, marveling at the bravery
of their opponents, not realizing that the
avalanche of men throwing themselves upon
them were fighting, not because they had
been ordered or compelled to, but because
they had before them every instant of the
time the ideal of liberty and freedom which
brought the United States into the conflict.</p>

<p class='c013'>With a detonation that threw Tom and
several other of the men flat upon the ground,
a tremendous German shell exploded just
ahead of them. It sent a great cloud of earth
and rock into the air, and before they could
arise a big tree, that had been completely
uprooted by the projectile fell directly toward
them. The others rolled out of the way, but
Tom was not quick enough. One of the large
branches pinned both his legs to the ground.</p>

<p class='c013'>As he tugged in vain to get his freedom,
George Harper crawled over to him. “Lay
still for a moment,” he instructed his friend,
“I think I can get you out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>With bullets whistling and singing all
about them, with now and then a shell
screaming its death message almost into the
pit where Tom lay an impatient prisoner, the
two lads worked frantically, but to little
avail. Although his legs lay in a slight depression,
which left him free of the weight of
the huge tree, he was nevertheless held fast,
and at last Tom began to urge Harper to
abandon him there until others came along.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll dig you out,” his friend replied, at
the same time poising his bayonetted rifle
for the job of scooping out enough earth to
permit Tom to slip his legs out of the trap.</p>

<p class='c013'>Harper was in that position when suddenly
his eye caught something in the fallen tree
which made him swerve suddenly. “You
beast!” he cried, and with all the gathered
force of his strong body he flung his rifle, as
a primitive savage would a spear, into the
nearby branches.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom, looking at that instant, saw the bayonet
sink to the hilt in a brutal-looking German
who at that instant was bringing up
his gun to fire upon them. With one agonized
grunt he crumbled, and then lay still; and
Harper, averting his head, recovered his
weapon.</p>

<p class='c013'>Obviously the Boche had been an enemy
sharp-shooter hidden in the upper branches
of the tree, and until that moment had remained
stunned by the force of the fall
precipitated by a shell from his own lines.</p>

<p class='c013'>Harper set to work instantly to dig Tom
out, but it was not an easy job. As he lay
there, virtually helpless, gazing up at the
sky and at the scores of aeroplanes dashing,
dodging, cruising about, he gave a gasp of
astonishment which also attracted his friend’s
attention.</p>

<p class='c013'>With consummate daring a Boche pilot had
dodged the apparently impenetrable American
air defenses, and, with half a dozen
planes pursuing and attacking him, was
making straight toward a big anchored observation
baloon that hung motionless in
the air a little to the north of where the
first wave of shock troops thus far had progressed.</p>

<p class='c013'>The tremendous pounding of the motors
rose even above the din of big and little guns.
From every point Allied planes were sweeping
down upon the Hun machine, but before
they could overtake him he had fired an
incendiary bullet at the baloon with unerring
aim.</p>

<p class='c013'>As it burst into a mass of flames that were
lurid, even in the now broad daylight, the
two men who had been occupying it as observers
jumped out. There was nothing else
for them to do, and probably it was not their
first parachute descent from a great height.
Nevertheless Tom gave an involuntary gasp
at the apparent cool courage of the men as
they leaped into space, and, for a distance of
fully a hundred feet, shot down with tremendous
speed toward the earth until their
parachutes opened up.</p>

<p class='c013'>They landed upon the opposite side of the
wood, and the men who had watched them
never learned whether they escaped in safety
or were killed in the inferno into which
they landed.</p>

<p class='c013'>In five minutes more Tom was free. The
fight by that time had forged steadily ahead,
and beyond the delay of stopping to ease the
dying moments of one brave fellow with a
last gulp of water, they rushed forward to
join the others of their platoon.</p>

<p class='c013'>As they passed through the wood, which
stretched longitudinally for a considerable
distance, but was comparatively shallow in
depth, they saw scores of Germans and not
a few of their own men, most of them dead,
others mortally wounded and dying, others
temporarily incapacitated but not so seriously
hurt, trying to staunch their own
wounds and hobble back to first aid stations.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a sight that struck to the very
heart of the lads, but looking backward for
an instant they saw the second wave of indomitable
men approaching, and scattered
through the occasional breaches in their lines
they saw that emblem of tender care and
mercy, the Red Cross.</p>

<p class='c013'>Where the Germans previously had dug
in, just behind the line of the wood, was
now a havoc of wreck and ruin, the whole
earth thereabouts having been churned and
plowed and furrowed by the terrific artillery
fire which the Americans had poured in preliminary
to the advance.</p>

<p class='c013'>From where they had swung round the
eastern end of the miniature forest, hundreds
of tanks were now bobbing up and down like
great, clumsy, fire-spitting beetles, as they
lumbered across this chaos of mounds and
gullies, paving the way for the renewed
infantry attack that would open with the
arrival of the second wave of shock troops.</p>

<p class='c013'>Actual fighting had been going on little
more than an hour, and yet the Americans
had progressed more than a mile beyond
where the first German line had been encountered,
had taken what the Boche had
regarded as an almost impregnable wood,
peopled as it was with sharp-shooters and
hundreds of machine gun nests, and by the
sheer courage and determination of their
attack had struck fear to the heart of the
Hun.</p>

<p class='c013'>Losses had been heavy, but they were slight
as compared with the casualties of the Germans.
It had been a fearful ordeal, and the
attack really had but just begun. The men
were begrimed, powder-stained and most of
them crusted with mud. But they were as
invincible now as when they started—and
more anxious to continue.</p>

<p class='c013'>Major Sweeney, his own left hand roughly
bound in a handkerchief betokening a wound
of some sort, dashed up for a hurried word
as he passed along the line.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Brave work!” he shouted. “You are
doing no less than was expected of you, but
much remains yet to be done. Make good
use of your short breathing spell. The next
half mile ought to be comparatively easy but
beyond that it will be more difficult. No
one of us, however, can have doubt of the
result. Civilization never will forget what
sacrifices you are making for it today. We
must not weaken for a moment now.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The enemy already is upon the verge of
an utter rout. We must make it complete.
He will stop a little further on to marshal
his forces and make a desperate and determined
stand. So far as possible we must
prevent him from succeeding in that aim.
We must keep him moving so fast that he
will be unable again to reorganize his forces
for effective resistance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All reports indicate that we are obtaining
our objectives at every point along the
line. Upon you men devolves the responsibility
of taking Thiaucourt—Thiaucourt at
all costs.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch06' class='c007'>CHAPTER VI <br /> <br /> <span class='sc'>Blasting the Enemy Out</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c012'>THE cheer which greeted Major Sweeney’s
speech was of itself a pledge.
The first of the men in the second
wave were arriving by that time at that
point where Company C, a little frazzled,
but with renewed determination, had rallied
those of its men who had come through the
first attack uninjured. The new arrivals
gave fresh energy and impetus to those who
thus far had borne the brunt of the original
contact, and again they made ready to resume
the big push.</p>

<p class='c013'>The sun had come out for the first time in
more than a week, and those who were aware
of it, who were cheered and strengthened by
its genial glow, believed that they saw in
the incident something significant of success
for the attack that had been so auspiciously
launched.</p>

<p class='c013'>Undoubtedly, from the first trend that
the battle had taken, the Germans had been
caught unawares, and there was little doubt,
either, that the onslaught, coming as it did
upon the fourth anniversary of their undisputed
possession of the St. Mihiel salient, contributed
further toward disorganizing the enemy
and completely breaking down his much-vaunted
discipline and morale. The wisdom
of American generalship dictated that he
should not be given a moment’s rest in which
to recover.</p>

<p class='c013'>By re-formed platoons and companies, the
vacancies filled in by the new arrivals, officers
and men began to move forward again to
hasten the Hun in his precipitate retreat.</p>

<p class='c013'>They had not gone many more yards,
picking their way from knoll to knoll, when
they began to sense something of the real
horror of warfare as the Germans waged it.
Sticking out here and there above the surface
of the ground like grim and ghastly monuments
were battered heaps of stone and
mortar—all that remained of houses which
once had stood there. This site had been a
village once!</p>

<p class='c013'>But what ruin had been wrought there!
What scenes of carnage, of brutality and outright
murder had been enacted here upon
this spot that the Americans were now traversing?
How many innocent noncombatants—aged
men and women, defenseless little
children—had had their lives snuffed out, or
were tortured to death, or were driven like
haunted wild beasts before that relentless,
pitiless advance of the Boches four years
before?</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom Walton, asking himself these things,
horrified by the thoughts and the terrible
picture they conjured, even as he threw himself
forward with the rest could not help
comparing this barren desolation of what
once had been a thriving, happy, harmless
community, with the peace and quiet of his
own country, even though it was at war,
and with the content and safety which he
and his kin always had known there. To
Tom the wretched scene about him was like
a terrible nightmare, and yet he knew that
it was in fact all too tragic reality.</p>

<p class='c013'>Unquestionably the day—not <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Der Tag</i></span>, of
which the Germans had so brutally and boastfully
spoken for four long years—but a far
different day, the Day of Retribution, was
now near at hand. It could not come too
swiftly or severely to avenge the horrors
which German invasion, Hun brutality and
Boche atrocity had inflicted upon the people
and the land of Belgium and eastern France.</p>

<p class='c013'>Stirring as were these reflections, thrown
with lightning-like rapidity across the mind
of Tom Walton and perhaps scores of others
who were fighting side by side with him, they
were but passing thoughts which speedily
gave way to the stern and hazardous realities
of the moment as a hail of machine bullets
from a dozen hidden nests again challenged,
and for a time halted, their further advance.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was another of those long, narrow, intermittent
stretches of wooded land that they
were approaching, and somehow, by the
exertion of almost superhuman efforts, the
Germans had thrown a hasty but temporarily
effective barbed wire entanglement in
front of it. It was another of those obstacles
which cost lives to overcome, but which had
to be thrown aside with the least delay in
order that the enemy might not have time
to marshal a recouped strength against the
oncoming line.</p>

<p class='c013'>But of the great fleet of aeroplanes that
kept dashing back and forth above, one
which had been especially assigned to watch
and report their progress, hovering over
them like a powerful winged guardian, had
seen their predicament and even as the cloud
of machine gun bullets mowed the first
unfortunate ones down the message had been
flashed to brigade headquarters, and almost
in the same instant an order to action had
been flashed to the commander of a nearby
squadron of heavy tanks that just had performed
a like service a short distance up the
line.</p>

<p class='c013'>Prostrate upon the ground, but with no
other protection than an occasional shell
hole afforded the luckiest of them, the men
saw the tanks swerve in their course and come
in their direction. Crawling, rolling, both
right and left, they opened an avenue through
which they might pass.</p>

<p class='c013'>With a loud and joyous shout that rose
high above the dismal song of death of the
bullets, the harried soldiers greeted the lumbering,
jolting approaching of the “Treat
’em Rough” branch of the American service.</p>

<p class='c013'>Dipping into ditches and shell holes, but
just as majestically taking the sharp and
rugged rises in the ground, bobbing, gliding,
sliding like antediluvian many-legged serpent-beasts,
they came on at a jogging, uneven
pace, much as might a great herd of giant,
iron-hided elephants, puffing and snorting and
spouting forth fire.</p>

<p class='c013'>To avoid casualties they slowed up and
proceeded cautiously through the little lane
created for them, flanked on either side by
indomitable doughboys, only awaiting their
passage through to be up and at the enemy
again, and who now, prostrate upon the
ground, were taking pot shots at the sheltered
Germans operating the machine guns.</p>

<p class='c013'>But once past that point where they might
hit or run down their own men, the tanks
proceeded with all the power and speed they
possessed straight for the sapling wood and
the wire entanglements in front of it. Machine
gun bullets pelted against their tops
and sides as harmlessly as drops of rain upon
a roof. Invincible to everything but the
larger guns, which had not yet made their
range, so viciously did the Americans in the
skies fight off the enemy observers, they
plodded on, barbed wire twisting and snapping,
trees cracking off and falling before
their terrible assault.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some of the men already were up and running
in the path of the iron monsters when
the shrill whistle of their captain brought
them to the ground. The tanks were coming
backward. To the uninitiated it seemed that
they were in full and precipitate retreat. For
a distance of perhaps forty feet they backed,
while many wide-eyed Americans looked on
in wonder; then they as suddenly halted, and
a second later again went forward.</p>

<p class='c013'>They had returned for a renewed momentum
with which to mow down the heavier
trees which had obstructed their course already
slowed down by contact with the
outer fringe of the wood.</p>

<p class='c013'>Suddenly, as though from out the sky,
there was a veritable avalanche of fire and
shell. Projectiles exploded everywhere, annihilating
men in the terrible force of their
concussion, laying others low with the deadly
rain of bullets and jagged chunks of shrapnel.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom with a sinking heart saw Ollie go
down like a log, but a couple of moments
later he was on his knees, adjusting his helmet
and putting more ammunition into his
rifle. Hours afterward Tom learned that
Ollie’s helmet had saved him, a piece of
iron having been driven against it with such
force as to knock him down and for the
moment stun him.</p>

<p class='c013'>But even as Ollie at the time was getting
to his feet, Tom felt something hit him in
the chest with a tremendous blow, and he
went staggering backward, feeling for the
wound. His blouse was torn, almost over the
heart, and as he regained his breath he felt
cautiously inside, certain he would withdraw
his hand covered with blood. Instead he
felt something hard and flat, with a sharp
dent nearly in the middle. He drew it forth.
It was a piece of metal plate nearly circular
in shape and fully three inches in diameter.
It was the piece of German shrapnel he had
dropped into his blouse pocket hours before
while in the trench, and undoubtedly it had
saved his life.</p>

<p class='c013'>But it was only an inwardly muttered
word of gratitude that Tom had time for
then, though he had seen his chum and himself
almost miraculously escape death within
the same minute. There was no living in
the terrific downpour of shells with which
the Germans desperately were trying to halt
the American advance. To go backward
was almost like admitting defeat, and no
man had even a thought of that. There was
but one course open, and that immediately
was ordered by Major Sweeney, in charge
of that particular part of the line.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of the five hundred men who had been
hurled at that particular position, at least
ten per cent had been killed off or wounded
in that fiery concentration of Hun artillery.
There was no time to move the wounded
then; it was a case of get the uninjured out
as soon and as safely as possible. In the
stress of bitter battle conservation of fighting
strength, man-power, often becomes the
biggest consideration.</p>

<p class='c013'>Therefore the units were divided into two
groups, one to strike eastward and the other
westward, to flank the wood in a northward
movement and at the same time to advance
more rapidly than German air scouts could
trace and report their position to the artillery
that was blasting away at them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom and George Harper were in a squad
chosen immediately to go forward as scouts
on the enemy’s eastern wing to endeavor to
ascertain the exact strength there, and, if
possible, to learn the location of the machine
gun nests from which the Boche were adding
to the havoc wrought by their artillery further
back. Their work was most hazardous.
Only the most cautious advance could obscure
their movements from dozens of snipers
hidden in the thick foliage of the trees. Most
of the tanks either had been crippled by the
shell fire or had been ordered to a safer distance
back, and only the best strategy could
bring the infantry into a position where it
could storm and take the woods.</p>

<p class='c013'>Under the leadership of a sergeant the
scouts crept forward. They attempted to
make a detour, but there was no cover of
darkness to obscure them; there was but a
scattering growth of scraggly weeds and upturned
rocks, and when but a short distance
on their mission a fusilade of bullets that
tore up the ground directly before them gave
them ample notice that they were not unnoticed—in
fact were about to be the especial
targets of German marksmanship.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom tumbled into the shell hole nearest
him, and he saw Harper do the same only a
few feet away. But as Tom rolled himself
into his place of safety he landed upon something
cushiony and soft. His landing also
was accompanied by an angry grunt. It came
from directly beneath him. In a flash Tom
had turned and at the same time maneuvered
himself to his hands and knees. He
was directly astraddle a fat German.</p>

<p class='c013'>The American lad took in the situation in
a glance. The Boche was bleeding from a
wound in the left hand, but otherwise, so
far as Tom could see, he was uninjured. But
if he had deliberately flopped into that hole
to avoid further fighting and surrender himself
in safety to the advancing American
troops, at least he had not forgotten the
characteristic treachery of his training, for
apparently he felt it would be a good piece
of work first to deprive the United States of
one more fighting man.</p>

<p class='c013'>He already had his revolver in his hand
when Tom managed to turn around, and with
a quick upward jerk he sought to bring it
into range. But Tom Walton had not been
the champion wrestler at Brighton for nothing,
nor had he forgotten any of the jiujutsu
movements which made him the peer
of any of his pals in any rough-and-tumble
contest. With a quick upward movement of
his right hand he gave the German’s arm a
twist which made the shot a harmless one
as he pulled the trigger. At the same moment
he brought his knee down in the man’s
stomach with a force that jolted the breath
almost completely out of him. But the
German was a powerful man, despite his
excess flesh, and as he made a grab for Tom’s
arm he also partly rolled over in a way to
endanger the younger man’s balance. Again
he tried to bring the gun into play, but with
a forward dive Tom took the only desperate
course open to him and sunk his teeth deep
into the Hun’s wrist.</p>

<p class='c013'>With a howl of rage and pain the fellow
began to yell “Kamarad! Kamarad!” but
Tom had experienced enough by this time
to know that his own life was not safe there
so long as that treacherous German remained
able to inflict an injury upon him.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pinning the German’s gun arm down to
the ground, Tom suddenly raised his head,
and as suddenly lowered it again and with all
his weight smashed into the Boche’s face,
billy-goat fashion. With a string of gutteral
sounds which Tom took to be oaths, his
enemy tried in vain to avoid this new attack.
It was an entirely new brand of fighting to
him, and what was worse in view of his whole
training, he was fast in close quarters and
could not hit and run. Before he had fully
recovered from this last shock Tom had managed
to draw his own gun. He fired, but
without time for any deliberate aim. The
German was just raising his own revolver, but
his arm dropped back limp and his eyes rolled
up into his head.</p>

<p class='c013'>With a shudder—for he had not yet become
accustomed to seeing men die—Tom suddenly
leaned forward, a feeling of sorrow overcoming
him, despite himself. But there was no need
of asking questions. The German was no
longer a menace to any man. The bullet had
hit him almost directly over the heart, and
his death had been instantaneous.</p>

<p class='c013'>Further consideration was cut short, however,
when the sergeant crawled over to the
same shell hole.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve reported to the major,” he said,
“and there’s no use of our attempting to go
further alone. Be ready for a sudden rush
attack and join in. What’s that you’ve got
there?” he asked, suddenly becoming aware
of the German under Tom.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s done,” came the even answer. “He
tried to get me first when I rolled in here,
and we had quite a set-to, but I was just a
little quicker on the trigger than he was.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good!” the sergeant exclaimed, and then,
in the same breath, “Our fellows are coming
now. Be ready to jump out when they’re
about alongside. We’re going to take that
wood and every living German in it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And as the sergeant a few seconds later
gave the word, Tom leapt out and joined in
the rush upon the wood. As he did so he
saw Ollie Ogden coming along with the rest.
But he looked in vain for his Brighton friend
and fellow scout, George Harper. He was
nowhere about.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch07' class='c007'>CHAPTER VII <br /> <br /> <span class='sc'>The Battle in the Wood</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c012'>WEARIED as they were with the long
hours of fighting, preceded by a
night of the most nerve-racking
vigil and anticipation, those lads went across
that intervening space and into the very
jaws of death as though it was their customary
exercise before breakfast each morning—went
singing, shouting and cheering,
oblivious to danger, seeing only a duty to
perform in the quickest possible way.</p>

<p class='c013'>For a full minute after the Americans
began their fearless dash, Heinie and Fritz
were so utterly dumbfounded by the utter
audaciousness of the assault that, except for
the steady descent of the heavy shells which
were falling harmlessly many yards away,
firing practically ceased. Consternation
seemed to seize the German snipers and
crews which manned the hidden machine
guns. The assault was so boldly carried
out, the attack was so swift and vicious,
that before they could recover themselves
the Americans were upon them, and mortal
man-to-man combat was on.</p>

<p class='c013'>Those who could get away in safety began
to run, but the two groups which had been
divided to escape the artillery fire had carried
on a simultaneously converging movement,
and most of those who occupied the miniature
forest were caught in a trap and compelled
to fight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom had gotten only a dozen yards into
the wood when he stumbled and fell. As
he fell he rolled down a short incline and
into the very heart of a machine gun nest.
Apparently the five Huns there were more
startled than he was, but he did not wait
to inquire. With a quick backward somersault
he hurtled himself out of the place,
and as he came to his feet he threw a grenade.
It struck upon the machine gun itself, and
exploded with a force that made his teeth
shake, but it did the work and saved his
life, at the same time eliminating five more
menaces to the peace of the world and human
happiness.</p>

<p class='c013'>Off to the left a machine gun of the enemy
was playing a vicious tattoo. Tom saw it
mow down four of his comrades, and realized
that situated as it was it was there to do a
great deal more damage if it was not captured
and its crew taken prisoners or killed.
He felt as though he, too, had been hit, and
then, from tree to tree, began worming his
way along the ground.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had just reloaded his rifle, in which the
bayonet was fixed, but he had thrown his
last grenade. He stopped for a moment by
a comrade who would never again need his.
Tenderly he clutched the explosive to him
and continued on his way.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was almost to the spot, and realized,
too, that he had gotten away from all the
rest, who were bearing off in a diagonal
direction, when he saw something darting
along the ground just ahead of him. At first,
in the semi-darkness of the wood, he thought
it was nothing but a shadow, perhaps only a
delusion of his eye or brain, but as he paused
it moved again, scarcely discernible as its
own color mingled with that of the ground.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Tom knew that it was a German—and
seemingly an officer—who was trying to get
away while the getting was good. He determined
that the German had not yet seen
him, and cautiously took up the trail, especially
as it was in the general direction
toward the machine gun nest. He might
have shot the man then, but the shot would
have revealed his own whereabouts and
probably save the machine gun crew, as well
as cost him his own life.</p>

<p class='c013'>Watching every move that his quarry
made, Tom stalked him as noiselessly as an
American woodsman would follow a wary
animal’s trail. He noticed as the Boche went
along on the ground, he seemed to draw
himself forward with only the right arm,
the other hanging limp at his side. A little
further on Tom found the faint pathway
spotted with blood. He crept closer. As he
did so he inadvertently stuck one of his own
hands into a smouldering pile of leaves which
had been set afire by a bomb or shell, and
the exclamation that escaped him made it
impossible longer to keep his presence there
unknown.</p>

<p class='c013'>The German turned quickly. Tom noted
all in one glance that he wore a fierce bristly
mustache turned up at the ends after the
style of Wilhelm, the Arch-Murderer, that
his complexion now was a greenish-white,
and that his left arm had been shot completely
off just below the elbow. But he noted
something more than that, even while he
covered the man with his gun, and the latter
stuck his right hand into the air in token of
surrender. The man was a colonel in the
Prussian Guards! A regimental commander
in what the Kaiser himself regarded as his
crack troops!</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom gasped in astonishment. Seeing that
the other made no move to get his own
weapon, the younger man lowered his rifle
the least bit, at the same time rose, first to
his knees and then to his feet, and then commanded
the German officer to stand up.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But keep that arm in the air, Colonel,”
he cautioned vigorously, “or I might get
nervous and pull this trigger.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Apparently the officer understood, and
maybe, too, he had some sense of humor,
for he not only did as Tom bade him to do,
but the features, that were distorted with
the torture of pain and fast ebbing strength,
for an instant were softened by just the
flicker of a smile.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You seem to be just a little more decent
than the rest, anyway,” Tom continued,
“and that arm needs attention pretty badly.
I’ll let that machine gun nest go for a few
moments while I turn you over to be taken
back a prisoner, and for treatment.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I thank you very much for sparing my
life and giving me this attention,” the German
colonel responded, in almost perfect
English. “You are very kind.”</p>

<p class='c013'>As Tom fell in behind him, after having
directed him which way to walk, he began
to marvel over the man’s accent, and in a
guarded way to admire the manner in which
he bore what must have been the agonizing
pain of his injury.</p>

<p class='c013'>They had almost reached the point where
Tom could turn his prisoner over to those
who would take him in charge and transfer
him to the rear and to a hospital, when they
came upon George Harper, propped up against
a tree, apparently asleep.</p>

<p class='c013'>But as he heard them approach he opened
his eyes, and then he did what to Tom seemed
a strange and unaccountable thing. He
jumped to his feet, showing no evidence of a
wound or other injury, and then, gazing
intently into the face of Tom’s high-ranking
prisoner, took a few more steps forward.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, Professor Schultz,” he exclaimed.
“If it isn’t the professor I’ll eat my helmet.
And with one wing gone, too, eh? You’re
not looking quite so well, professor, as when
I saw you last.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom, who had listened to this in surprise,
turned toward the colonel as though expecting
him to explain it, but the German officer
only tried to tilt his head a little higher,
make his mustaches appear a little more
formidable, and maintained an absolute silence.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He don’t want to recognize me now,”
Harper explained to Tom. “He’s got good
reasons, too. The only good it will do him
to have that arm fixed up, now that he’s
recognized, will be to get well enough to be
stood up before a firing squad.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The erstwhile proud colonel made a move
as though he would make a dash for his
liberty.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, no you don’t,” George Harper
snapped, at the same time levelling his gun
at the officer. “No more of that funny work
this time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Keeping the prisoner covered with his gun,
he turned again to Tom.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This professor-colonel and I have met
before,” he explained, “and the latest time
was a few hours ago. I got separated from
you fellows and tried to rush a machine gun
nest. I was just about to throw a grenade
when this fellow caught me in the stomach
with a whacking big rock. It was the handiest
weapon to him, for his revolver had been
shot out of his hand. I’ll say for him that he
throws well. It knocked me out completely.
When I came to my senses I could hardly
move, but I remembered one thing, and that
was that the man who laid me low was the
one-time Professor Schultz, confidence man
and swindler, indicted and sought by half a
dozen different States, but particularly wanted
by the United States Secret Service as a daring
and dangerous spy. Some record you’ve
got, eh, Schultzy—pardon, professor, I should
address you as colonel—the crookedest colonel
I ever knew.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Will you take him back?” Tom asked,
amused despite himself at the manner in
which George Harper delivered himself of his
information regarding Schultz.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I sure will,” his pal responded. “I want
to get back into the thing as soon as ever I
can, but honest, that fellow sure can heave a
rock, and I feel as though some of my intrals
have gotten too crowded together. Maybe I
need a little repairing myself. I’ll be right
back again, though. Come on, Schultzy,”
and Harper and his prisoner trudged off.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom started back for the machine gun
emplacement which had been his objective
when the German colonel crossed his path,
but he found it had long since been silenced
and swept aside, and his own comrades were
far ahead of where they had been when he
took his prisoner.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were now nearing the other side of
the wood, with its open land beyond, but the
rear guard of the Germans still were fighting
stubbornly, the reason for which Tom learned
later. The only way the German officers
could compel those poor dupes left in the rear,
to stand and fight until the rest had started
well upon their escape, was to tell them that
the Americans were barbarians in war and,
if they captured German soldiers, would
torture them to death. A Boche prisoner,
fearful even of accepting a cigarette, fearing
it was poisoned, until the man who offered
it stuck it into his own mouth and began to
smoke, finally told his captors the secret of
what they previously had put down to
courage upon the part of the Hun fighters.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom, coming upon the rigid resistance as
it was being shown at the fringe of the wood,
jumped into the thick of the fight just as
“Buck” Granger went down with a bullet
wound in his right leg. “I’m all right, don’t
bother about me,” the brave fellow shouted,
as Tom wavered and was about to stop.
“Just a little hit in the calf. I’ll hobble
along all right.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Better stay where you are,” Tom advised
him, “and if I come through myself I’ll
be back for you later in the day. The Red
Cross stretcher men will be along shortly
anyway, and they’ll give you a lift.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The injured man nodded, the while he
nursed his injured leg, the knee drawn up
under his chin, and Tom started off.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say!” Granger shouted, before he was
out of hearing, “just give Fritz a couple for
me, will you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do my best,” Tom called back, and disappeared.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was no more than out of “Buck’s”
sight when a German, lying prone upon the
ground, and whom Tom thought dead, fired
point blank at him. The bullet tore through
his right sleeve and left a stinging sensation
on his arm. With fixed bayonet he charged
before the man could shoot again.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was the second man he had killed at close
range that day. The sight sickened him.
He hurried on. There was the great difference
in the armies. The Germans seemingly
killed for the lust of killing. The Americans,
only because it was the only way in which
to save humanity, rescue or aid martyr
nations, and redeem civilization to the world.</p>

<p class='c013'>As he reached the edge of the wood, a
hundred feet from the nearest of his own
men, he thought he heard a voice weakly
calling him—calling him by his own name.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Tom Walton!” Silence, as he looked
around; and then again, “Tom Walton!
Here I am, over here.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was scarcely more than a weak and quavering
whisper, and the very ghastliness of it
sent the chills running up and down Tom’s
spine as fire and bullets couldn’t make them
do.</p>

<p class='c013'>He looked in the direction from whence
the voice seemed to come, and saw a man in
an American officer’s uniform stretched out
upon the ground. His face was smeared
with mud and blood and was distorted in
mortal agony.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom ran to his side. He was tugging at
his blouse, as though to open it. Tom gazed
into his face again, and then gave a gasp of
shock and astonishment.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, Major,” he gulped, “Major
Sweeney, are you badly hurt?”</p>

<p class='c013'>The officer tried to answer, just the effort
of a smile flickered for a moment on his
swollen lips, and he weakly motioned toward
Tom’s water flask.</p>

<p class='c013'>A few swallows seemed to relieve him a
little, and with his head pillowed in Tom’s
arm he tried to move a bit, but it was no
use. The attempt was too painful, and he
was fearfully weak. Tom instantly realized
that. He looked around desperately for help,
but there was none immediately at hand.
The major, evidently divining his intention,
gave a slight wave of the hand. It expressed
much. It was the inborn heroism of the man—the
man under whom Tom had trained and
come over seas, the man for whom he
had the greatest respect and the deepest
affection.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In there,” the major gasped, after a terrible
effort, motioning toward an inner pocket.
“Important papers—took them from German—officer.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom reached into the pocket and extracted
what seemed to be a packet of maps and
instructions. Major Sweeney was lapsing
into unconsciousness, but he rallied himself
with a great effort, and, in a voice which
Tom now had to lean close to hear, he continued:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Take them—to—brigade head—quarters,”
he reached feebly and let his own
quivering hand drop upon Tom’s. “Tell
them—Major Sweeney—sends—his—respects
and he’s—going west.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The voice ceased, the big frame quivered
slightly for just the fraction of an instant,
and then lay still. Tom Walton knew that
for his brave major the end had come. Gently
he laid the form upon the ground. Tears
were running down his cheeks. Tenderly, as
though it had been his own father, he smoothed
back the matted hair.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Major Sweeney,” he repeated, in a choked
whisper. “Gone west.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And then the long tension snapped, his
head dropped forward and his body was
shaken by convulsive sobs.</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_45_0_65 c012'>BUT if there is sadness in battle, so also
at times does it have its humorous
aspects, some of which are ludicrous
to an extreme.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was just that sort of a reaction that
Tom Walton got when, having laid the body
of Major Sweeney on a little knoll by the
side of a tree, he again laid siege to the enemy
line.</p>

<p class='c013'>By this time it was a general free-for-all
at that particular point, and it was vicious
and close-range fighting. Tom was having
all he could do to defy two Germans, one of
whom was doing his best to bayonet him,
while the other was trying to brain him with
a rifle butt, when Ollie Ogden suddenly
appeared upon the scene.</p>

<p class='c013'>With a single leap—and no one to this
day knows why he adopted that method of
attack, except that men often do strange
things in the stress of battle,—Ollie was upon
the back of the man trying the bayonetting.
His two arms were gripped about the German’s
throat, and his feet were twined
affectionately around his waist and over the
stomach. From all appearances he was there
to stay awhile.</p>

<p class='c013'>The other German—he who had been so
seriously intent upon crushing Tom’s head
in with the butt of his rifle—was so startled
by the strange performance that he stood
gazing as though stricken, while Tom with a
sudden wrench took the gun from him and
added him to the list of prisoners.</p>

<p class='c013'>But by this time a dozen men on both
sides had abruptly suspended hostilities to
watch the antics of the big German with Ollie
on his back. The latter seemed to be enjoying
it as much as anybody.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Hun first clawed desperately to disengage
Ollie’s strangle grip upon his throat,
and failing in that, vainly transferred the
same tactics to disengaging himself from the
latter’s feet.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Ollie held the whip hand. Or rather,
he held the bayonet hand; and with this
weapon, rather more effective than a cavalryman’s
spur, he reached backward and downward
and gave the German a none too gentle
jab just beneath where he himself sat perched.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dunder und blitzen!” shouted the big
Boche, as he began to buck viciously to dislodge
Ollie from his back.</p>

<p class='c013'>Even the Germans who were looking on
laughed. But even as they did so they
realized that they had let down their guard
and that everyone of them within range was
covered with an American rifle and was a
prisoner unless he preferred sudden death.
They realized that the Americans could
conduct warfare and enjoy a little humorous
diversion at the same time.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a shock to several of them, but
they seemed suddenly to realize that it was
good, rather than bad, fortune, and they
gave themselves up entirely to the enjoyment
of their comrade’s misery.</p>

<p class='c013'>“’At a boy,” yelled one Company C man
to Ollie, “make ’im prance.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And Ollie, enjoying himself immensely
and not at all loth to give his companions all
the fun they desired, suddenly loosened one
foot, gave his mount a quick backward kick
in the stomach, which elicited a tremendous
grunt, and amid a shout of laughter which
made men many yards distant turn suddenly
in their fighting, the German started off at a
full gallop toward his own lines.</p>

<p class='c013'>For a few moments it looked bad for Ollie,
unless he elected to make a quick drop, for
none of the Americans dared shoot at the
Boche for fear of hitting him. But either
blinded by his rage, or bewildered by the
sudden trick that fate, in the shape of a
young American, had played upon him, the
German suddenly turned, made two or three
more grotesque bows in futile effort to throw
Ollie from his back, and then came racing
back toward the American lines.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Give ’im the hook! Give ’im the hook!”
came a chorus of advice from lusty members
of Company C, and Ollie, interpreting the
hook to mean the pointed instrument otherwise
known as a bayonet, on the end of his
rifle, proceeded to follow instructions. It
was rather a vicious jab, which made the
German suddenly draw himself in at the rear
and expand in the stomach in a most ridiculous
manner.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gott in Himmel, kamarad!” he shouted
in a voice that could be heard above the
thunder of cannon and the cracking of rifles.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was purple in the face, his breath was
coming in sharp snorts, and what strength
he had left he was exhausting in vain efforts
to swing his rifle back to knock Ollie from his
perch. In his final vicious lunge the gun
slipped from his hands and went skimming
through the air, narrowly missing the heads
of several of the German prisoners.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Kam—kam—,” he gasped, but he hadn’t
breath to finish the word. He tried to buck
again, his knees weakened and folded under
him, and Ollie, seeing what was coming,
leaned far back and gave a sudden thrust of
his weight forward. The German pitched
headlong and with a terrible grunt hit the
ground, Ollie still astride him.</p>

<p class='c013'>For several seconds he lay there gasping
in utter helplessness, and then he rolled over,
almost frothing at the mouth in his rage and
humiliation. He started to shake a fist at
Ollie, and a sergeant gently rested his bayonet
on his chest.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come on, Prince,” he ordered, to another
gale of laughter. “You can show us some
new steps on the way to the rear of the line.
Barnum and Bailey want you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The big fellow rose to his feet, and suddenly
spying one of his fellow countrymen
grinning, gave him a slap across the face
which sent him reeling.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Kamarad!” yelled an American youth
mockingly, and the hostilities ended as swiftly
as they had begun.</p>

<p class='c013'>The sergeant ordered two men to accompany
the batch of prisoners to the rear, after
all of them had been disarmed, and the last
seen of Ollie’s bucking broncho whom the
sergeant called Prince, he was leading the
procession, glum but silent.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t try that again,” the sergeant commanded,
feeling impelled to administer some
rebuke to the spirited young Ollie; but even
as he spoke his mouth twitched suspiciously,
and he turned suddenly to say something to
another group of men.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No sergeant,” answered Ollie demurely,
and a dozen soldiers grinned broadly, even
as they brought their rifles up and started
forward into the thick of the fire again.</p>

<p class='c013'>Why none of them had been hit while they
stood forth as open targets, watching the
strange performance which Ollie staged, remains
one of those mysteries of Divine
Providence.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were out in the broad open land
beyond the wood now, and in the distance
they could see what still remained standing
of Thiaucourt, the objective for which they
had fought so valiantly, and for the attaining
of which so many of their brave comrades
already had died.</p>

<p class='c013'>The battle took on a new fury. From every
conceivable shelter machine guns popped
away at the advancing Americans, who were
without protection against the terrible fire.
There was no chance to dig in. Their furthest
thought was to turn back. Orders were to
take the town. Speedy advancement, even at
great cost, was the only course open to them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Seemingly every standing bit of battered
wall and terrace protected one or more of
the German rapid-fire guns. Where was their
artillery? Why didn’t the American heavies
pave the way? The answer was obvious.
The infantry had far outdistanced the artillery,
and the tanks had become stranded for
the time being on the opposite side of the
thick wood. Clearly there was nothing to
it but an infantry onslaught that with many
deaths as the price would carry the town
by storm.</p>

<p class='c013'>But just at that moment when many a
man and officer, stifling criticism or complaint,
nevertheless was thinking that too
terrible a task had been placed upon them,
a broad dark shadow passed between them
and the sun, and more speedily than any cloud
ever travelled on a clear day, flitted across
that blood-soaked intervening stretch of land
and toward the town.</p>

<p class='c013'>Instinctively Tom and scores of others
looked upward. As if in one voice there rose
a tremendous cheer. Above them was the
greatest armada of the air the world had
ever seen. It was heading directly for a
point above Thiaucourt, and another piece
of shrewd strategy was being revealed.</p>

<p class='c013'>As enemy anti-aircraft guns began to send
their projectiles toward the fleet, it suddenly
swerved upward and into a zig-zag course,
but its general direction remained unaltered.</p>

<p class='c013'>Every conceivable sort of aeroplane was
in the formation. In the centre, convoyed
and surrounded by swifter, lighter, more
easily manipulated planes, were the great
bombers, manned by crews of five, six, eight,
ten and even a dozen men. These were to
inflict the damage, while the others fought
off all interference, acted as scouts and couriers,
or in other ways guided the attack and
kept the headquarters informed of the progress
made.</p>

<p class='c013'>And then occurred one of the most thrilling
feats—or happy accidents—ever witnessed
in the air.</p>

<p class='c013'>Half a dozen of the one-man scout planes
were scurrying along in the formation of an
upright V. A dozen enemy anti-aircraft guns
were trained upon them. One sent a shot
squarely into one of the two highest of the
planes. It staggered for an instant, and a
quick gasp went up from the American
soldiers on the ground as it suddenly crumpled
and began to fall.</p>

<p class='c013'>But they had not recovered their breath
when the pilot, somehow extricating himself
from his seat in the falling plane, gave a
wild leap. His jump was inward in the
V-shaped formation. Men held their breath
as he dropped straight downward. Then
someone gave a shout. It was all in the
fraction of a minute, but it seemed an eternity
of time. So far as could be seen from the
ground his leap was but a few yards to the
next plane, and he was almost directly
above it.</p>

<p class='c013'>The shout that had been one merely of
startled anticipation broke into tremendous
applause as, for only a second, the falling
man was obscured from sight by the wings
of the plane under him, and then that plane
quivered for a moment as with a tremendous
shock, then righted itself, and the pilot,
evidently divining rather than having seen
what had happened, and having received the
frantic signals of half a dozen pilots nearest
him, began a slow and cautious descent
downward.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He landed safely!” one man shouted
frantically.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Looks like it, but he may be unconscious
and roll off any minute,” another supplemented.</p>

<p class='c013'>Men stood breathless, their hearts seeming
hardly to beat, in the face of this most thrilling
of all the excitements they ever had
witnessed or participated in.</p>

<p class='c013'>Four other heavier planes stood by the
smaller one as it began its descent, and then,
“Look! Look!” the cry went up, as a big,
swift German machine hovered for a moment
in the skies like a giant vulture, then swooped
downward with a speed that was startling,
straight for the little group that had formed
to save a single American life.</p>

<p class='c013'>Even as it did so, two large American planes
detached themselves from the bombing formation,
and headed for the Boche. They took
him on either side just as he opened his
machine guns at the smaller planes below.
Throughout the war there was a chivalry
among the airmen of the enemy armies that
was at once an inspiration and an honor. The
few violations of it gave it greater emphasis.
This pilot evidently was one of those brutes
who, had he been a submarine commander,
would have taken rescued men upon his deck,
and then submerged, to let them drown like
rats; or one, maybe, who could calmly murder
children, girl children, of his own country,
and mutter, “One less mouth to feed.” For
it is of record that some Germans did commit
these and even greater atrocities throughout
the war.</p>

<p class='c013'>From a little above and on either side of
him, the American planes opened a terrible
fire—it was a fire of machine gun and incendiary
bullets—and a dozen struck him at
the same time. There was a burst of flame
that swept the plane from stem to stern; its
nose suddenly turned downward, and with
a dive that only narrowly missed the little
group on which the German had directed his
attack, he fell to earth a mixed and mangled
mass of man and mechanism.</p>

<p class='c013'>As the group of little planes flew by, not
more than a hundred yards above them, on
the way to a safe landing place half a mile
in the rear, another shout of approval went
up from the men on the ground. And just
over the rear of the top wing of one of the
machines a grinning face appeared and a
waving arm seemed to send back a genial
how-do-you-do.</p>

<p class='c013'>It might have been the signal too, for the
tremendous aerial attack that was at that
moment launched upon the German gunners
and infantrymen, hidden in what they believed
the safe and impregnable protection
of the town. Tons upon tons of highly explosive
bombs were dropped, as the big fleet
circled and circled over what once had been
a happy and prosperous French village. A
constant cloud of thick black smoke went up
as incense to Mars, and every attempt of the
German airmen to attack the bombers was
repulsed with disaster.</p>

<p class='c013'>Finally two swift scout planes detached
themselves from the fleet, dashed for nearly
a mile northward over the German army,
then as suddenly turned and continuing on
back beyond the machines they had helped
convoy, made straight for where temporary
brigade headquarters then stood.</p>

<p class='c013'>In five minutes the orders came to the men
who had witnessed these scenes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The enemy is retreating, leaving only a
small rear guard. Advance and take the
town. Remain there for further orders.”</p>

<p class='c013'>That meant that they were within sight of
rest and recuperation, and every man needed it
badly. They were a tired and frazzled but
determined lot. They were ravenously hungry,
too, for they had not eaten for many,
many hours.</p>

<p class='c013'>Detachments of engineers were coming up
directly behind them. The enemy artillery
was grumbling now from an increasing distance,
coming only in a scattered fire, the
gunners evidently taking pot luck, without
any well-defined idea of where the Americans
might be.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Advance!” The order rang out all down
the line, and the men went forward on the last
lap of the bitter battle for their first objective.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='sc'>The Khaki-Clad Warriors Surged Into the Town for  Hand-to-Hand Combat.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>For half an hour there was some hard
fighting, and then the Germans, what remained
of them, threw up their hands as
the khaki-clad warriors surged into the town
for hand-to-hand combat.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a clean-cut victory, even though at
heavy cost. Far to the north could be heard
the grumbling rumble of the German guns,
but even as the men listened they knew
that the course was swinging eastward, ever
eastward, to avoid the pitiless pincers that the
strategy of Foch and Pershing were beginning
to close relentlessly upon them, eastward
toward the Rhine!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dig in!” And the most welcome news
of the day, the promise of a night of needed
rest, was responded to with alacrity. No
chances were being taken with German
trickery.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was late afternoon and dusk was laying
its cloak over the land when a brigadier
arrived, briefly consulted with Captain McCallum,
and then departed. In a moment
he returned, however, and again spoke to
the company commander. The latter turned
abruptly and called the name of Tom Walton.</p>

<p class='c013'>Wonderingly Tom approached and saluted.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thomas Walton,” the captain announced,
in what Tom thought were terribly solemn
tones, “by order of the commander of this
brigade I advance you to the place of sergeant.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What—,” Tom began impetuously, even
for the moment forgetting discipline.</p>

<p class='c013'>“For the capture of a German colonel, who
is also a much-wanted spy,” the general
supplemented. “Young man, I congratulate
you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom came to a stiff salute; the general
responded, turned abruptly and strode off.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom Walton was left with his captain to
be assigned to his new duties.</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c012'>IF one wants to know the real tragedy of
war, he does not have to see the battle
waged; he need not watch men fight and
fall, need not hear their anguished moans,
nor even witness their awful agony. He has
only to be with a company, a battalion or a
regiment when the tally of casualties is made
to hear—when the weary struggle relaxes
for a few hours, and there is comparative
peace and quiet—the calling of the roll, with
those fearful, ominous silences that follow
name after name. One more closely visions
then the human holocaust, and finds his mind
wandering in dismal, useless, melancholy
speculation. He wonders, and wondering,
too vividly pictures to himself, what has
happened “out there” to those brave men
who are not present to respond to their names.</p>

<p class='c013'>He knows that sometimes the explanation
lies in the fact that they have become separated
from their own units in the fighting,
and, unable to get back, are for the time
attached to entirely different regiments. But
more often the cause is all too clear; and
comrades who have safely survived the terrible
ordeal—who silently close up the ranks
that have been left with great gaps—stand
at rigid attention, their faces as fixed masks,
their hearts torn by sorrow.</p>

<p class='c013'>For friends whose real worth has been tried
and proved in the acid test of bloody battle
and in the face of death, have “gone west”—west,
as the fine but futile sentiment of an
awful loneliness likes to picture it, to the
place, the far distant place, where home is;
west, to the land of the setting sun, where
there is no war, no death, where all is peace
and quiet and happiness.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gone west!”—as one repeats it many
times the tragedy of it drops away, and the
expressive words take on the tranquility of
a benediction.</p>

<p class='c013'>As men stood ready to drop in their tracks
at Thiaucourt that night, too weary to move,
utterly exhausted mentally and physically
by the terrific strain under which they had
been for the last twenty-four hours, it was
the unpleasant duty of roll-call that fell to
Sergeant Tom Walton.</p>

<p class='c013'>He would far rather have escaped it, but
discipline required that he do the task at
hand without murmur or complaint, and it
was in this case as it is so often in war—the
sooner over, the better for all.</p>

<p class='c013'>And so he took up the roster of the company,
cast a swift glance over the men before
him, and in what he tried to make a dull
monotone, began.</p>

<p class='c013'>From time to time some man suddenly
would stiffen and his lips would be drawn
into a hard line, as the name of his “bunkie”
was called and there was no response. When
Tom knew of his own knowledge that one in
his own ranks had been killed or wounded,
he skipped over his name with only the
quickest articulation, going rapidly to the
next, in order that no undue emphasis might
be laid upon the casualties that had befallen
Company C in the brave assault that had
more than obtained them their given objective.</p>

<p class='c013'>But there were others—a great many others—of
whose absence he was not aware, and
after each of these names there was that awed,
painful silence in which time had to be taken
to record the fact that the man was among
the missing. They were intervals in which
it seemed that a pin could be heard dropping
upon the ground. Men gave no outward
sign of their grief, but each knew what all
the others felt.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was Tom himself who broke the terrible
strain of the thing. He was down the alphabet
as far as O.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jockey Ogden,” he suddenly called; and
as Ollie responded with a brief but energetic
“Here, but without mount,” a laugh
ran along the line, and everyone felt better
for the merest excuse for throwing off the
inevitable melancholy accompanying roll-call
after battle.</p>

<p class='c013'>When it was over, Tom sought out Ollie
and Harper, who by that time had returned
to his company, assured that his “bang in
the slats,” as he expressed it, at the hands
of Tom’s later prisoner, was perhaps painful,
but in no way a permanent or even serious
injury.</p>

<p class='c013'>In subdued tones Tom told them of the
death of Major Sweeney. Would they go
with him back into the night and over the
ground they had traversed that day, to find
the body and give it decent burial? Would
they? Why, of course they would.</p>

<p class='c013'>And through the mind of each was running
the same thing. How it was Major Sweeney
himself to whom they had first gone when
they had determined to enlist together—Major
Sweeney, whose house near Brighton
always was open to boys of that school; who
was always ready with a helping hand, and
who personally had coached the best football
eleven that Brighton ever had put upon
the gridiron.</p>

<p class='c013'>Brave, big-hearted Major Sweeney! He
had told the boys that night when they
visited him at his home that within a few
days he would depart for service. He had
been commissioned a captain, and if they
desired he would try to see to it that they
were assigned to his company. And true
to his word he had.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now he lay out there on the edge of that
wood where so many lives had been sacrificed,
an American hero, gone to his last
reward.</p>

<p class='c013'>With the permission of the Captain the
three youths armed themselves with searchlights,
the sentry pass-word, spades, a hammer
and saw. It was Sergeant Tom who
thought of a little can of paint and a brush.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was half an hour before they reached
the wood, and an hour later before they found
the body. It was a ghastly business, and
more than once they thought they were at
the right spot, only to find that the search
must be renewed.</p>

<p class='c013'>When at last Tom’s sense of direction
brought them to the exact place, they found
the body lying just as Tom had left it, the
blouse still slightly open, the hair smoothed
back, the right hand resting peacefully on
the breast.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let him be buried near the spot where
he fell,” said Tom, in subdued tones, as,
sticking his searchlight into the ground so
that it would give them sufficient light, he
thrust his spade into the dirt and began
preparing his major’s grave.</p>

<p class='c013'>Harper and Ollie joined in the work and
within another half hour they had gently
placed the body in its last resting place. To
Tom fell the duty of saying the brief rites;
a handful of dirt was thrown in, and then,
anxious to have an unhappy duty over, they
completed their task as rapidly as possible.</p>

<p class='c013'>While Ollie and Harper were doing that,
Tom had sawed from a broad tree limb two
fairly lengthy slats. These he nailed together
in the form of a cross. And upon
this cross he began to paint.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had inscribed the lateral board with
the Major’s full name, and the battalion he
commanded, and then abruptly he stopped,
looking far over the desolate open stretch
and through the black night to where he
knew Thiaucourt to be—Thiaucourt, which
had been their day’s objective; Thiaucourt,
for the possession of which so many courageous
Americans had died; Thiaucourt,
where the men who had survived now lay
stretched in heavy slumber; Thiaucourt,
quiet and peaceful now and giving no evidence
of the terrific battle in which it had
been the goal.</p>

<p class='c013'>And Tom, taking his brush in hand again,
dipped it into the can and painted a brief
inscription:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_6_0_65 c012'>AS Tom and his two companions turned
from their sad task with one last
lingering look at the rough grave
wherein lay the body of the brave man who
had been their friend and advisor, as well as
their superior officer, they became aware for
the first time that the advance contingent
of Engineers had progressed to that point
on the edge of the wood, working frantically
in the felling of trees and the repairing of
the roads and ground over which the day’s
battle had raged, to make passageway for
the ambulances to carry away the wounded,
for the trucks bearing food and munitions,
for the heavy and light artillery, the tanks
and all the other vast and inevitable retinue
of an army advancing in successful combat
with an enemy.</p>

<p class='c013'>From these men of the Engineer Corps the
lads learned that the combined American
and French attack upon the west leg of the
salient, launched simultaneously with their
own assault northward, had been attended
with the same success; while vague messages
also repeated to them from around on the
north of the huge bulge, where the French
were pushing southward with an irresistible
weight, indicated that swiftly and surely
Allied strategy was vindicating itself in a
persistent closing of a great pincers-like
movement which threatened soon to entirely
cut off thousands upon thousands of Germans
from their main army, now in retreat. For
they were in momentary danger of being
trapped in a veritable pocket of annihilation
by this quick closing-in process.</p>

<p class='c013'>The great question now was how rapidly
these divisions could follow in the retreat,
and whether or not the Americans could, or
under present plans intended, to entirely cut
off their avenue of escape before they could
emerge from that desperate position.</p>

<p class='c013'>Already in the distance, over the ground
which the Engineers had prepared, they
could hear their own artillery rumbling forward,
seeking placement for the tremendous
bombardment that soon would be resumed.
For the present, though, there was a comparative
quiet and silence that seemed ominous.
The boys expected it to be broken
at any moment by a tremendous roar of guns,
with their accompanying flash of exploding
shells. Their nerves were taut in subconscious
anticipation of it. Yet nothing happened,
and as though they, too, were under
orders not to awaken the night, they picked
their way cautiously back toward where their
own company had halted in the attack,
speaking only infrequently, and then in
hushed whispers.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was Ollie, walking between Tom and
George Harper, who suddenly laid a detaining
hand upon the arm of both. They looked
at him questioningly in the almost unbroken
gloom of the night, but they could see dimly
that he was peering forward, and trained by
this time to the constant vigil of warfare,
they followed his gaze without a spoken word.</p>

<p class='c013'>Both saw what Ollie had been the first
to discover. A hundred yards ahead of them,
against the sky line, they could make out
the silhouette of a man, stooping over a
form that lay prone upon the ground. As
he moved about, his actions were cat-like in
their quickness. Once in awhile he hesitated
to peer about him, but with the background
of the heavy wood behind them the lads
remained unseen, while able to observe every
action in the strange, even weird performance
being enacted before them.</p>

<p class='c013'>The man was not a stretcher-bearer, neither
was he a surgeon, else he would not have
been alone. It was several minutes, while
their vision was being focussed to the scene,
before it dawned upon the lads what was
taking place. It was Tom who breathed
the words in a scarcely audible tone.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A spy,” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c013'>It seemed impossible that the man out
ahead could have heard, but he stopped suddenly
in his hurried work, crouched further
forward over the dim form on the ground,
and peered all about him after the manner
of some wild beast of the jungle, sensing the
approach of danger. For several moments
he remained in that position, while the three
lads stood motionless, scarcely daring to
breathe.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the end of that time, apparently assured
that he was still undiscovered, he raised
himself slightly and went to his work again.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was no doubt as to his object now.
He was frantically tearing at the clothing of
the man beneath him. It all became as clear
as daylight now to the three boys from
Brighton. There could be no further doubt
about it. The man was a German scout
spy who somehow had remained in, or gotten
back to, the territory taken by the Americans,
and he was now fulfilling his mission by searching
the dead in quest for secret orders, maps,
plans and photographs, which would arm
his superiors with valuable information as
to the method and direction of the campaign
which had been launched with such success.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We can’t advance directly without being
seen,” whispered Harper, drawing the others
close to him so that they might hold a hasty
consultation. “And we daren’t shoot from
here, because there’s the barest chance that
he may be one of our own men, although it
is a hundred to one against it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’re right,” Tom agreed. “There is
but one thing to do, and that is for two of
us to circle in on him from either side, while
the other pushes slowly forward, giving us
time to get near him without being discovered
ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sh-h!” Ollie warned; and then, in a tone
scarcely to be heard, “Look! Apparently
he’s found what he was after.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was true. Even as Ollie had spoken,
and the others had turned swiftly to look
back again to where the treacherous enemy
was in quest of information which might
greatly hinder and harass the American advance,
the man cautiously raised himself and
began moving forward, away from where the
lads stood.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had gone only a few feet, however,
while the boys were debating as to what
was the best course for them to pursue,
when he again stopped, and they could just
make out that he was bending over another
still shadow on the ground. It was becoming
ghastly. Was he in reality a spy? Or was
he, after all, one of those most despicable of
all human beings, a ghoul, prowling about in
the night, robbing the helpless, plundering
the dead?</p>

<p class='c013'>There was but one way to find out; there
was but one course open to them. They
must follow out Tom’s plan, without further
delay, and if possible come upon the man
before he scented danger or knew of their
presence, capturing him in the very act of
his search.</p>

<p class='c013'>A hasty council was held. They could
go back and get assistance from some of the
Engineers, but this possibility held no weight
with them. They would trap and take the
man themselves. And with this decided
upon, it then was agreed that Tom should
circle forward on the right of the stranger,
while George Harper carried out a like flanking
movement on the left, leaving Ollie to
creep almost directly forward after he had
given them sufficient time to begin closing
in. All three were to arrive as a human net
about the man as nearly as possible at the
same time.</p>

<p class='c013'>As Tom and Harper crept away and out of
sight, Ollie remained standing where they
had left him, his gaze glued to one spot,
never for an instant taking his eyes from the
swiftly-working man of mystery, except in
those rare snatches when, to retain a clear
vision, he had to look away and blink several
times in quick succession when he found the
constant stare dimming his sight and blurring
his perspective.</p>

<p class='c013'>Scarcely time enough had elapsed, however,
for Tom and George to get well under way on
their perilous mission, when the stranger
turned suddenly from his work, gazed long
and steadily in the direction from which Ollie
knew Tom Walton would be approaching,
his whole attention concentrated upon something
out there which Ollie could not see.</p>

<p class='c013'>Instinctively Ollie raised his revolver, training
it upon him, ready to fire at the first
indication that Tom himself was in danger
of being shot or ambushed. But if the man
was armed, he evidently had no taste for
thus attracting general attention to himself,
except in the direst emergency. From his
actions it seemed equally certain that he
either had seen or heard Tom approaching,
or by that sixth sense of intuition, sensed his
danger without knowing exactly what it was
or where it lay.</p>

<p class='c013'>Even as Ollie stood there, silently alert,
covering the fellow with his gun, the latter
dropped suddenly flat upon the ground and
like a writhing serpent began to glide quickly
forward and into the gloom ahead. As he
did so his form was no longer shadowed
against the sky line—in fact could be discerned
only occasionally and with difficulty
as he sped along with almost incredible
agility.</p>

<p class='c013'>Ollie ran forward swiftly but silently for a
distance of several yards, and then dropped
to the ground also, replacing his revolver in
its holster so that he might the better hurry
along on hands and knees in quest of the
fleeing enemy.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once or twice he stopped for the double
purpose of raising himself to make sure he
was keeping in the trail of the man ahead,
and to listen for indications of the approach
of Tom or Harper. But while, thus far, he
was keeping to the right path and making
good progress, there was no sign of the
presence, or even proximity, of his two pals.</p>

<p class='c013'>Already he was approaching the spot where
they first had discovered the fellow at work,
and where Tom and Harper should now be
closing in. But Ollie realized what handicaps
they had to overcome, and also how easy it
would be for either to mistake the distance
to be covered before they swung inward
toward their objective. Either or both might
now be considerably off their given course,
and without present knowledge of their exact
whereabouts. Meanwhile the man they
sought was steadily pushing forward and
away from them, into the blackness of the
night.</p>

<p class='c013'>Much as he would have liked to wait for
his two friends, Ollie decided that if the
enemy was to be kept in sight and finally
captured, he must continue to go forward
alone. And with the thought he proceeded.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had gone scarcely more than another
thirty feet when something happened that
for the instant seemed to make his heart
stand still and the blood to freeze in his veins.
Momentarily he had lost sight of his quarry.
In that instant while he groped about him,
undecided as to his exact position and the
direction he should pursue, the cold steel of
a revolver barrel was thrust against his right
temple, and Ollie for the first time was aware
of the presence of another man, not more
than two feet away from him.</p>

<p class='c013'>It may have been that only a fraction of
seconds elapsed, but to Ollie, rigid and helpless
in the darkness, unable to see his opponent
or make a single move, it seemed like
an eternity of time, in which sudden death
was inevitable, before a low voice close to
his ear commanded, “Put up your hands!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Ollie could have shouted with joy and
relief. He could have embraced the speaker
in a great hug. Instead, he very wisely
followed a policy of “safety first.” He put
his hands straight into the air, as directed,
and as high as he could reach, so that there
might be no mistake as to his intentions.
Then he whispered sharply, “Tom, it’s Ollie;
for the love of Mike take that gun away
from my head. I don’t like the feel of it at
all. You might get a sudden twitching of
that trigger finger.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well I’ll be hanged,” ejaculated Tom
Walton, in a hushed and rather abashed
tone. “It’s good I didn’t shoot first and
speak afterward. I thought you were that
Hun. Where is he?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not so loudly,” warned Ollie. “I don’t
know where he is now, but I only lost sight
of him a few seconds before you poked that
gun to my head. He had started for home.
He ought to be out there straight ahead
somewhere. Wonder where George is?”</p>

<p class='c013'>There was no time to loiter, however, if
they were going to capture the man they
were after, and after waiting for several
seconds without hearing or seeing any sign
of their friend approaching, they began
cautiously and silently to push forward again.</p>

<p class='c013'>Stretched out almost flat upon the ground,
pulling themselves forward by handgrips upon
the turf, only occasionally raising their heads
to take a hurried but unsuccessful survey of
the vicinity to locate the enemy, they finally
came upon the first of the bodies over which
he had been working.</p>

<p class='c013'>They had made no mistake. The most
cursory glance showed that the dead man
was a captain in the United States army, and
that every pocket of his uniform had been
rifled. Not only that, but the shirt beneath
had been torn loose and the chest was bared,
showing that the most thorough search had
been made for anything of value that might
have been concealed there.</p>

<p class='c013'>The lads paused for a moment in an effort
to identify the officer, but it was out of the
question even to attempt to read his identification
tag, and a shell fragment had so
mutilated his head and face that in the darkness
it was impossible for them even to guess
who he was. With a suppressed sigh and a
muttered threat against the man who thus
had defiled the dead, they pressed onward,
but without any definite idea as to the exact
direction they should pursue, or how far
they ought to go.</p>

<p class='c013'>The second body was that of a first lieutenant,
and here, also, the search had been
complete. The boys had no doubt that each
had had upon their persons explicit instructions
of the whole advance, at least so far as
it was purposed that their units should
participate in it, but not the slightest trace
of a paper, map or photograph could be
found on either of them. Capture of the spy,
therefore, was imperative.</p>

<p class='c013'>But where was the enemy who had committed
these thefts? A few moments before
he had been plainly visible to Ollie. The
latter had crouched down again to continue
his own advance, and when he again looked,
the man had disappeared completely. True
it was a dark night; but the open space was
broad, and he had been clearly silhouetted
against the skyline. It was inconceivable
that he could have covered a sufficient distance
in the meantime to take him out of
sight of the lads. They decided, therefore,
to continue on.</p>

<p class='c013'>Their disadvantage and handicap was now
doubled, however, for while they had lost
all track of the enemy, there was no assurance
that by this time he had not discovered
them. For all they knew he might be watching
their every movement. It increased their
caution, and when, on the still night, they
heard the peculiar low whistle that probably
no one else would have noticed, or taken for
a human sound—the code signal of the three—Tom
responded ever so lightly, and they
sat down to wait until Harper should come up.</p>

<p class='c013'>When finally he did, they held another
whispered council. They agreed that while
for the time being the search seemed hopeless,
it ought not to be abandoned; and they
suddenly realized, too, that with an enemy
concealed somewhere in the darkness, it was
highly dangerous for them to attempt to
proceed directly back to their own company.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the denser darkness of a clump of bushes
they halted to consider what course they
should pursue. Each turned his mind to a
solution of the problem. For several moments
no word was spoken, and the faint rumble of
distant guns worked upon their dulled senses
like a soothing lullaby.</p>

<p class='c013'>Poor, tired, overworked and overwrought
youths! They had forgotten to take the
inexorable laws of nature into their calculations.
Even as they attempted to think,
they drowsed. Heavy-lidded eyes closed,
and they slept.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now, if ever, were they completely at the
mercy of a conscienceless enemy, who might
creep upon them and kill before they could
make an outcry or a move in their own defense.</p>

<p class='c013'>Fate was stalking in the night.</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c012'>HOW long they had been asleep Tom
had not the faintest idea when
with a sudden, startled jump, he
came to a bewildered wakefulness. He felt
deeply depressed, and he was distinctly aware
of a feeling of alarm and a sense of impending
danger. He could not account for any of
the sensations. Whether someone had touched
him, or he had been awakened by a sound,
he did not know. Perhaps he had been
dreaming. He could not tell that, either.
Indeed, it was a full minute after he came
back to consciousness before he recognized
his surroundings and realized where he was.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then he remembered that George and Ollie
had been with him. He reached over, touched
them both. Ollie groaned slightly in his
troubled sleep, and Harper turned restlessly.
They were safe, anyway. Tom tried to fathom
the strange feeling that possessed him, but
he could no more come to an explanation
of what caused it than he could shake it off.</p>

<p class='c013'>He peered into the darkness. Nothing
there to cause alarm, so far as he could see,
but still that disconcerting feeling of some
unknown, unplaced menace. Tom decided
to waken his pals. He was not afraid, in
the sense of being a physical coward. It
was the baffling mystery of the thing and
what it might portend that was so disquieting.
Perhaps it was just overwrought nerves;
or maybe the strange surroundings in which
he found himself when he awakened. He
tapped Ollie two or three times upon the
shoulder, and nudged George Harper with
his foot. He disliked to deprive them of their
sleep, but he felt that he must. It was not
only the necessity of talking to them about
this strange feeling that he could not get rid
of; it was even more imperative that they
return and join their company, which at
any hour now might suddenly be ordered
to renew the action.</p>

<p class='c013'>But even as Ollie and George almost
simultaneously grunted sleepy and impatient
objections to this treatment, although at
the same time opening their eyes and starting
upright, Tom would have given a great
deal had he left them to their sleep—and
silence.</p>

<p class='c013'>For, hardly the fraction of an instant
before they had given half conscious utterance
to their plaintive growls, Tom had seen,
as clearly as though it had been daylight,
the head, then the shoulders and half the body
of a man rise suddenly from a shell hole
ahead, as though directly at the sound.</p>

<p class='c013'>Instinctively Tom knew by the way the
man moved that he was not wounded.
Equally obvious was it that whoever he was
he was not an American, for all this territory
now was held by those forces, and
one had no need to hide if he was a friend.</p>

<p class='c013'>This man was in the very act of swiftly
climbing out of his hiding place when Tom
spied him. At the first sound of the sleepy
voices he had as suddenly dropped back
and out of sight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Never for a second taking his eyes from
the spot, Tom warned his two friends to
silence in a way that quickly brought them
to their senses, and they crept close to hear
his briefly whispered statement of what he
had seen.</p>

<p class='c013'>Unquestionably it was the same man they
had been seeking before they dropped off
to sleep. Each had a feeling of shame that
they should have weakened that way when
there was an urgent necessity before them.
How long had they slept? It was a useless
question. Two facts were apparent, however.
It was still night, so they could not have
been out of the hunt for long; and they
knew the whereabouts of the enemy they
sought.</p>

<p class='c013'>One method of capture presented itself
to them, and that was to creep forward in a
surrounding movement and then lay there,
as close to the hole as they might, without
themselves being discovered, and wait for
the man to make his reappearance. They
were without bombs and could not attack
that way. They had no rifles, either, and
were entirely dependent upon their automatics.
Even with these, they realized,
there was danger to themselves in the positions
they would be in, in any cross firing.</p>

<p class='c013'>However, there was no other way open.</p>

<p class='c013'>Caution, already a sort of second nature to
them, was sharpened by the knowledge that
their presence also was known, and by the
realization, too, that this German—for there
no longer was any doubt in their minds
as to that—should not elude them a second
time, possessing as he did information which
must not fall into the hands of the Boche
commanders.</p>

<p class='c013'>As it turned out later, however, the man
in hiding had good reason for electing to take
his chances on escape, rather than lay there
until daylight, when capture would be inevitable
if he was then still alive.</p>

<p class='c013'>While the three lads were yet some distance
from the spot, proceeding in a spread-eagle
movement, Harper in the centre, the
fellow made a wild jump from the hole.
Three shots rang out almost simultaneously.
With a groan the man crumpled up on the
edge of what had been his hiding place.
The lads waited for a moment, to make sure
it was not a ruse, then swiftly ran upon
him, all three covering him with their pistols.</p>

<p class='c013'>Considering the darkness and the quickness
of the shots their marksmanship had
been highly creditable. One bullet had hit
the German in the right hip, another in the
calf of the left leg, while the third had grazed
his neck. He was painfully, although not
critically wounded; but he was entirely out
of the fighting for the time being.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom stripped him of his automatic and
made sure he had no other weapons, but
even wounded as the fellow was he tried to put
up a resistance when Ollie opened his blouse
and abruptly drew forth a packet of papers.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That means your finish, Fritz,” Harper
ejaculated, but the wounded man only grunted
viciously.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Search him carefully and see what else
he has collected in the way of valuable
souvenirs for his superiors,” Tom instructed;
and Ollie continued to investigate every
possible hiding place in or under the German
lieutenant’s clothing.</p>

<p class='c013'>Evidently he had canvassed a large stretch
of ground, for he was a veritable walking
library of secret orders, maps and photographs
taken from American officers. While
Ollie was doing this, and Harper was discouraging
any resistance by a threatening
play of his automatic, Tom walked around
to take a look into the shell hole. It had
just occurred to him that the captured German
might not have been working alone.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the darkness Tom took a false step.
Before he could regain his balance he went
feet first into the hole and disappeared completely
from sight. When he landed it was
with a grunt that told that the breath had
been pretty well jarred out of his body, and
the Hun, even in the pain of his wounds,
laughed outright.</p>

<p class='c013'>Ollie leaned over the hole and looked in.
He expected to see Tom’s face almost on a
level with his. Instead, he could but dimly
discern him, several feet below.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Holy smoke!” he ejaculated, involuntarily.
And then, “Oh, Tom, are you hurt?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No,” came the response, “only jarred.
But this is <i>some</i> shell hole. I’m just beginning
to get my breath. Felt as if I was
dropped from an aeroplane. My searchlight
seems to be burned out. Drop yours
down to me; I want to look around. Easy
now—reach down as far as you can and
then let it go. I’ll try to catch it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>By mere good fortune he did. In an
instant he had switched it on, and its glare
was followed by a quick gasp from Tom and
an involuntary expression of surprise.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is it?” asked Ollie, still leaning
over the edge of the pit.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is it?” Tom repeated. “I don’t
know yet, but it’s not a shell hole, that’s
one thing certain. There’s a long tunnel
that leads away under the ground here, and
it’s big enough for a man to walk through.
It runs almost due north from here, so far
as I can see, but the light’s not strong enough
to show how far it goes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A tunnel!” Harper repeated, at the same
time fixing the German with a severe stare.
But if the prisoner understood, he gave no
sign. His only expression was one of pain.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ollie,” said Tom, who now as a sergeant
could command the other two, although
he had no disposition for any unkind or unjustified
use of his authority, “you’d better stay
there and watch Fritz, while Harper drops
down here with me. We’ll trail along the
secret passageway that the Germans didn’t
build for nothing, and see just where it leads.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll keep an eye on him, you can bet,”
Ollie answered, as Harper, by the aid of the
light Tom threw upward, dropped warily
into the deep entrance to the secret tunnel.</p>

<p class='c013'>In another moment Ollie was left alone
with his prisoner, and Sergeant Tom and
George Harper had disappeared from sight
and sound, Tom in the lead, flashing the
searchlight’s rays before them as they went,
Harper following close behind.</p>

<p class='c013'>They found the artificial passageway to
be at no point less then five feet in height,
and on the dirt surface of the flooring were
imprints leading them to believe that many
persons had passed back and forth through
there at a comparatively recent date. Its
course was almost directly northward, and
the lads could at all times see some distance
ahead. Nevertheless they proceeded warily,
not knowing what sort of a trap might be
set for them. The air was heavy and damp,
but gave them no great discomfort until
they had proceeded for several hundred
yards, and then they concluded that the tunnel,
whatever its purpose, had but one outlet,
and that was the one through which they had
entered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you realize where this is leading?”
Tom asked presently, as he half turned toward
Harper.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Unless my sense of direction is all off,”
George responded, “directly under Thiaucourt.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Straight as an arrow,” Tom added, “and
we ought to be almost under the town by
this time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>No longer could they hear the dull rumble
of the guns, and their own voices echoed
and re-echoed down the cavernous passageway,
the only interruptions in an otherwise
dead silence.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hello!” exclaimed Tom suddenly, in a
note of new surprise, and an instant later
the far wall flung back the word at them as
though someone there were repeating it in
mockery. There was something unpleasant
about the situation. It was like wandering
around aimlessly in the dead of night in an
abandoned house reputed to be haunted,
not knowing what startling surprises awaited
one at any moment.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom’s exclamation escaped him when he
noticed that the tunnel apparently came to a
dead end about twenty-five feet ahead. A
moment later, however, it was apparent
they were approaching a right-angled turn.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom extinguished his own light to see if
any ray came from down this new passageway,
but there was nothing but pitch blackness,
in which neither lad could discern the
outline of the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>Snapping it on again they proceeded slowly
until Tom stood within a foot of the abrupt
turn in the wall. The new tunnel ran
directly to the right of the direction in which
they had been approaching. With a sudden
forward thrust of his head, Tom took a quick
survey of what lay beyond.</p>

<p class='c013'>He drew back with a gasp, and his free
hand fell upon Harper’s arm.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look!” was all he could say for the
moment, and Harper, following Tom’s bidding,
drew in his breath sharply, then gave a
low whistle.</p>

<p class='c013'>They had made a discovery of tremendous
moment! But had they made it in time?</p>

<p class='c013'>“Out! Out!” Tom ordered. “We may
be blown to atoms any second if we stay here.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And indeed it was true. The sharp turn
in the tunnel brought them into a great
cavernous chamber in which there must have
been at least fifty tremendous bombs, all
connected by copper wires with a heavy
cable which hung suspended from the ceiling.
It was obvious that during their long occupancy
of the St. Mihiel salient the Germans
had dug this tunnel and planted these mines,
for just such a contingency as now existed—enemy
occupation of Thiaucourt. And while
neither lad was an engineer, both knew
sufficient about bombs to realize that there
were enough there to blow the whole town
site off the map and annihilate every person
within a radius of more than half a mile.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ten thousand men are quartered on the
space that those bombs would blow up,
and the Germans may touch them off at any
time! Run! Run!” Tom ordered, and,
setting the example, he bounded by Harper,
the searchlight held out before him, tearing
toward the mouth of the tunnel as fast as
his legs would carry him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They’re probably waiting for that German
lieutenant to return,” Tom managed to
speculate jerkily, without in the slightest
reducing speed. “It’s pretty clear now that
he was down here—to see that everything
was all right—and put on—finishing touches.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeh,” agreed George, “and it just occurs
to me now that he wore the insignia of the
Signal Corps.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wanted those papers,” Tom supplemented,
“so as to know when the largest
number of our men would be over the spot.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Uh-huh,” from Harper, but by this time
neither had further breath to spare on conversation.
They were forcing themselves forward
with every ounce of energy they possessed.</p>

<p class='c013'>As a gray light, barely discernible, loomed
in the distance, they knew that at last they
were approaching the mouth of the tunnel,
and that the first streaks of dawn had
appeared.</p>

<p class='c013'>Winded as they were, neither had the
strength to climb the smooth-sided hole as
the German evidently had done, by the main
strength of the pressure of his legs against
the walls as he made his way upward.</p>

<p class='c013'>George squared himself with widespread
feet, and Tom mounted to his shoulder.
Ollie, who was still guarding the prize prisoner
and awaiting their return, began popping
questions, even as he helped Tom out of the
hole, but the latter had no time for more
than the essential facts then.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Use your jacket as a rope and give Harper
a lift out of that hole,” he instructed, and
while this was being done he partially regained
his breath.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now Ollie,” he continued, “go like the
wind to the first officer of Engineers you can
find, tell him we’ve discovered that everything
under Thiaucourt is mined, and get
back here with the necessary men as soon
as you can.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He turned to Harper. “You stay here and
watch this German. I’ve still got breath
enough left to make brigade headquarters
in a very few minutes. Don’t let Fritz get
away under any circumstances.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And at the same instant Tom and Ollie
sped away in opposite directions—Tom for
the highest commanding officer he could find;
Ollie back over the ground they had traversed,
past the grave they had dug, and into the wood
in search of an officer of Engineers.</p>

<p class='c013'>Both knew that thousands of lives were at
stake. Both put forth their bravest effort.
For both realized that if they succeeded at
all it would only be in the nick of time.</p>

  <h2 id='ch12' class='c007'>CHAPTER XII <br /> <br /> <span class='sc'>The Desperate Chance</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_6_0_65 c012'>AS Tom, in the gray of the breaking
dawn, came pounding into the lines
which surrounded the thousands of
sleeping soldiers, he nearly precipitated himself
upon the out-thrust bayonet of a sentry
whose call of halt he did not hear.</p>

<p class='c013'>His breath coming and going in quick,
sharp gasps, Tom managed to give the
countersign, adding, “Sergeant Walton, Company
C.” The sentry lowered his rifle and
Tom proceeded; but a few yards further on
he was compelled to repeat the process. For
once he wished that all sentries were asleep
on their posts.</p>

<p class='c013'>At brigade headquarters he encountered a
man who refused to get excited, and who demanded
to know in detail what it was Tom
wanted before he would waken his own sergeant
to see if the message could be delivered
to the general.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I tell you,” Tom blurted out, in rising
tones, “the life of every man here is in danger.
This place is likely to be blown off the map
any minute. The whole place is mined. I’ve
just seen the bombs—scores of them—in a
big underground chamber directly under the
town. I’ve got to speak to someone in
authority.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s that you say,” demanded a staff
major, suddenly appearing on the scene.
He had heard the last few words, and as he
peered into the face of Sergeant Walton, who
immediately came to a salute, he seemed
instantly to sense the seriousness of the
situation.</p>

<p class='c013'>Briefly as possible Tom repeated his startling
information. The major rattled off some
orders to the sentry and a sergeant who had
appeared, then left suddenly, telling Tom to
wait right there.</p>

<p class='c013'>In an incredibly short time the brigadier
general, followed by most of his staff, emerged
hurriedly from a dug-out.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are certain of this?” the general
demanded sternly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Absolutely positive,” Tom answered. “I
fell into the mouth of the cave myself, in
helping to capture the German who had just
come out of it, and when I found that it was
a long tunnel, leading directly northward
toward this spot, I led the way through it.
We came upon a large underground chamber
practically filled with big bombs, all connected
with a cable. I should measure the distance
we travelled as bringing that chamber almost
beneath where we are standing now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Had Tom himself thrown a bomb into the
midst of the gathered staff members it hardly
could have caused greater consternation.</p>

<p class='c013'>The general waited for no more. He barked
a dozen orders to as many different officers
in rapid-fire succession.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come with me,” he instructed Tom and
those officers who had not yet been charged
with special duties. He led the way quickly
to a dug-out further down the line. Before
they reached it bugles were sounding, men
were tumbling out of their blankets, rubbing
their eyes and looking about sleepily. Staff
officers were shouting the orders for immediate
movement. Officers and men who heard,
looked around hurriedly for signs of the enemy.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the dug-out the general ordered one of
the several men sitting at telephone instruments
to connect him immediately with the
commanding officer of the nearest unit of
Engineers.</p>

<p class='c013'>To this officer he indicated as definitely as
he could the position of the mouth of the
tunnel, and ordered him to be there as quickly
as possible.</p>

<p class='c013'>“To dig out mines,” he summed up.
“They’re already connected up, I believe.”
And seeing the first of the thousands of
men under him already on the move for
designated points beyond the danger zone,
he took a part of his staff with him, and with
Tom in the lead, set out at a vigorous double-quick
for the point where George Harper
still was guarding the man whose movements
indirectly led to discovery of the mines.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meanwhile Ollie had encountered even
greater difficulties than Tom in his search
for the commanding officer of the Engineers,
for although he went directly to the wood,
he found only small squads at work there,
the main body having progressed in a circling
movement to the northward of the town, to
prepare the pathway for the day’s advance.</p>

<p class='c013'>When, after the greatest difficulty, he
finally did locate the headquarters of the
colonel, he arrived there just in time to see
the latter and his aides departing at the head
of a hundred men.</p>

<p class='c013'>Saluting a lieutenant, Ollie started to tell
him his story, but was cut short with the
information that the news already had been
received and they were then on their way.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But you arrive at a good time,” the lieutenant
added quickly, and addressing a superior
he informed him that Ollie could take
them directly to the spot.</p>

<p class='c013'>And thus it was not without a justifiable
feeling of being of some real importance that
Ollie was called to the colonel’s side, and
walking beside that officer, to direct the way,
was plied with questions as to the discovery.
It was little enough that Ollie could tell, for
Tom had given him but a bare outline of the
danger that confronted the troops. Nevertheless
the colonel thanked him warmly, not
forgetting to add a word of praise for all
three of the lads after he had been told how
it happened that the mouth of the tunnel
had been discovered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And you got your man after all?” he
asked, when Ollie had finished, having touched
but lightly upon the fact that all three had
at one time dropped off to sleep.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir, he’s wounded,” the lad responded.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, he’ll probably wish he had been
killed outright,” was the colonel’s cryptic
comment.</p>

<p class='c013'>As if in reply to that remark, German
guns far to the north let go a salvo of shells,
several of which fell uncomfortably near.
The colonel glanced in the direction from
which the projectiles seemed to come, but his
pace never wavered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Fritz seems to be out of bed, anyway,”
was all he said, as another shell exploded not
a hundred yards to the left of them, throwing
up a veritable geyser of dirt and rock and
splinters of steel.</p>

<p class='c013'>As they came over a little knoll, Ollie
pointed out where the tunnel entrance was,
and the colonel raised his glasses to get a
better view as he walked.</p>

<p class='c013'>Approaching, from an about equal distance
beyond the spot where Harper and his prisoner
sat, were the general and members of his
staff. It was when both parties were within
fifty feet of the entrance to the passageway
that a shell exploded with such violence and
in such proximity that it knocked both Harper
and his prisoner on their backs. For a moment
everyone thought they had been killed.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was Ollie, who with a feeling of dread,
realized the real damage that that shell
might have done; and as misfortune would
have it his surmise was right. It had landed
directly over the tunnel, a few yards beyond
its entrance, and with such force as to cave
the whole thing in!</p>

<p class='c013'>As the general and colonel arrived almost
simultaneously, the situation and its necessities
became clear. It required but a moment’s
investigation by one of the members of the
Engineers Corps to verify the fact that the
passageway had been effectually blocked by
a great wall of earth caved in by the shock
of the exploding shell.</p>

<p class='c013'>The general held a short consultation with
the colonel of Engineers, and then called both
Tom and Harper to them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Young men,” he said, “we are going to
place a great deal of reliance upon your
judgment and sense of direction. A straight
line drawn from the entrance of this tunnel
to the spot where the shell caused a cave-in
shows that you were right in saying that it
ran almost directly north from where you
started. You are sure it takes no turns?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not until the very entrance to the bomb
chamber,” Tom answered quickly; and Harper
corroborated him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Very well,” the commander went on
quickly. “If that is true, then we are saved
some unnecessary labor. It is not likely
that we could dig directly into the tunnel
from any given spot, but we will proceed
directly northward to a point which you
consider near to the chamber, but yet a safe
distance away, then try to effect an entrance.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And with competent engineers directing a
true northward course, they proceeded rapidly
toward Thiaucourt.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom, who had been considering the distance
carefully, came to a halt and saluted.
“I would suggest, sir, that perhaps this is
as near as is safe to begin the digging.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Very well,” the general replied, and
nodded to the colonel.</p>

<p class='c013'>A moment later fifty men with spades
were lined up before their commander for
instructions. He marked the spot where the
tunnel might be, and then, at right angles
to the direction they had walked, or almost
directly east and west, he established an
imaginary line.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dig along that, working toward this
point at the centre,” he ordered. “Somewhere
along that line you should strike the
tunnel. Proceed with care after you are six
or seven feet deep.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Every man there had a fair idea of what
depended upon cutting the connection to
those bombs before, somewhere to the north,
a German hand reached for a switchboard
and turned on the current that would cause a
holocaust. Also, they knew that they were
about the closest in proximity to those hidden
mines, so there was no lack of incentive for
all the speed that strength could muster.</p>

<p class='c013'>Dirt flew out of that ever deepening and
lengthening pit in a constant cloud, piling up
a high trench work on either side. But despite
the care to which they had cautioned, it was
the muffled exclamation of surprise from a
man suddenly dropped downward with a
great accompanying scraping and crashing of
earth, that heralded the discovery of the
tunnel.</p>

<p class='c013'>The general and colonel both smiled their
congratulations to Tom and Harper at the
accuracy of their report. At the same time
spades worked with feverish haste, the man
who fell into the tunnel was extricated undamaged,
and the hole was rapidly widened
to let two or three in at one time. Then
another halt was ordered.</p>

<p class='c013'>The colonel spoke.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A short distance to the north of us is an
underground chamber supposedly filled with
highly explosive mines. They are wired
and, it is believed, are directly connected up
with the German lines. Apparently the
enemy has been waiting for the concentration
of a large number of troops here before
touching off the mines. He may decide to
do so at any moment. I want volunteers to
go into that chamber and sever the cable
connection.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Instantly every man present stepped forward.
The colonel’s face glowed with pride,
and the general nodded approvingly. This
was the spirit which made America invincible!
One looking at the general’s fine countenance
saw there satisfaction, absolute assurance.
A nation could not fail with men like these!
And they but typified the entire United
States army.</p>

<p class='c013'>The colonel rapidly picked half a dozen of
the men he thought best fitted for the hazardous
task at hand, and under the guidance of
a clean-cut captain they dropped into the
tunnel and disappeared from sight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Agonized moments dragged by, and scarcely
a word was spoken. The colonel had suggested
that all hands move further away from the
danger zone, but as he and the general gave
no evidence of doing so themselves, none of
those present, no matter how they felt about
it, showed the hardihood to seem to want to
escape, when a little group of their pals
probably at that very moment were struggling
with the heavy cable which at any time
might be charged with the death-dealing
current.</p>

<p class='c013'>Every man present held his breath when
the captain suddenly dashed into sight,
quickly lifted himself to the ground, and,
grabbing a spade from one and a pair of
rubber gloves from another, started back
over the line which the tunnel followed to
the bomb chamber.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Connection’s cut, but I want to see
something,” he told them.</p>

<p class='c013'>As he began digging they gathered in a
wide circle about him. Presently he struck
a hard metallic substance. With a wave of
his hand he requested them to get to a greater
distance. A few more cautious jabs with
the spade and he stooped over, gripping something
with both hands and tugging upward
with all his strength. The blood rushed to
his face and the veins on his neck and forehead
stood out, but after a little the thing
he was pulling began to give way.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was the severed cable. With a final jerk
he pulled the loose end through the ground,
and all hands could see where the cut had
been made. At last the terrible menace was
over. The captain looked triumphantly at
his superiors. He laid the cable on the
ground.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t go near it,” he cautioned, “because—”</p>

<p class='c013'>The sentence was never finished. There
was a sudden sharp crackling, a gasp of
exclamations from the throng, and a shower
of sparks shot into the air from where the
severed cable end lay upon the ground.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Germans had turned on the current,
but they had turned it on a moment too late!</p>

<p class='c013'>The narrow margin by which a terrible
tragedy had been averted was obvious to
all. They stood about, awed and silent,
watching the deadly current expend itself
in a harmless sputter.</p>

<p class='c013'>The general himself was a man of few words.
He summoned the lads to him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Young men,” he said, “I congratulate
and thank you. You have saved an army.
It will not be forgotten.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And the three youths flushed deeply as a
lusty cheer went up from the men gathered
about them.</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_6_0_65 c012'>AS the three lads, hoping for a snatch
of sleep before the orders came for
a renewal of the battle, settled into
their blankets in a dug-out which only forty-eight
hours before had been occupied by
Germans who held forth there in that sublime
assurance born of four years of uninterrupted
and practically unchallenged possession, Ollie
Ogden chuckled audibly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the matter now?” demanded
George Harper, none too graciously, for
already he had drowsed, and the injection
of humor, particularly when the cause was
unknown, was not altogether pleasant.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom, too, looked sharply at his friend,
but with other reason. For an instant he
feared that the low laugh was the first hysteria
which is the forerunner of one phase of shell
shock—that dreaded punishment when taut
nerves break, the mind snaps, and a strong
man temporarily is transformed into a cowering,
jabbering, pitiful hulk of his former self,
actuated by one thought, escape from the
thing that caused his mental wreck.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Tom’s one quick glance was sufficient
to assure him. To be sure Ollie showed the
same evidences of fatigue as did the others;
but all three had built up for themselves, in
the sports and athletics at Brighton, constitutions
which it would require far more than
their experiences of the last twenty-four
hours to break, harrowing as those experiences
had been, and Ollie was only giving
vent to amusement at a sudden thought that
had flashed through his mind.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What are you giggling at?” Harper
demanded again, now only half awake.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Remember that relay race at Brighton,”
Ollie answered, “when you, Tom, ran the
first mile, George the second, and I was to
finish with the third?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Aw, can’t you ever forget that?” Harper
interrupted, peevishly. “What’s the idea of
rehashing that thing again?” he added,
suddenly forgetting his sleepiness.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m not rehashing it,” Ollie assured him,
in soothing tones. “I was just thinking
about it, that was all.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, what’s that got to do with us and
this war?” George demanded, showing no
disposition to abandon the subject which
always was an unpleasant one to him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, it just occurred to me that it was
somewhat of a parallel case in a way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What way?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom also was evidencing an awakened
interest, and cast another inquiring glance
at Ollie.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll tell you,” the latter answered, at the
same time giving Tom a sly wink which
entirely escaped the other youth, who at
that time with belligerent movements was
disentangling himself from his blanket, in
order to get into a sitting posture.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well tell us,” he snapped. “You might
as well get it off your mind.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now don’t get so peeved,” Ollie soothed
again. “It’s nothing to get so excited about.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, no, of course not,” from Harper
again. “Nothing to get excited about, of
course. Well, are you going to tell us what
you were grinning and sputtering about a
moment ago?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure,” Ollie answered, “if you’ll just give
me half a chance.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go ahead, I’m not interrupting you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You remember, Tom,” again giving him
the wink, “that you got so far ahead of the
others that you had the race practically won
at the end of the first mile, when you touched
George’s hand, and he was off, to maintain
that lead to the end of the second mile, when
I was waiting to finish up?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” Tom drawled, trying vainly to
suppress a smile, while George squirmed
uneasily and had to interrupt with, “You
always have to review the whole thing, don’t
you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>As George seemed about to break forth
with another impatient interruption, Ollie
turned to Tom again with another grimace.
“It wasn’t George’s fault that he started
across country in the wrong direction,” he
went on. “We all know he didn’t do that
on purpose. He ran like the wind, all right,
but it just happened that he ran the wrong
way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>There was a distinctly audible grunt of
disgust from Harper.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I remember,” Tom responded in
tone so obviously sympathetic as merely to
aggravate the victim of the story further.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, as I stood there with the relay men
of the other teams,” Ollie continued, “and
as one after another they were touched off
and were away, I kept wondering and wondering
what in the world could have happened
to Harper, and—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’ve said all that at least a dozen times
before,” the latter interjected again. “What’s
the idea of—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And finally the last man was away, and
still I stood there, just wondering and wondering—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And wondering, like a blamed idiot,”
Harper shot out again, in deep disgust.</p>

<p class='c013'>Ollie went on as though there had not
been an interruption to his reminiscence.</p>

<p class='c013'>“At last I gave up in despair and trudged
back to Brighton. Remember,” to Tom,
“the race was over before George ever
stopped. Didn’t even hesitate until he’d
reeled off about five miles, and then it took
him an hour to get back, after he’d realized
he was away up the county and far off the
course of the race. Well, I just recalled how
I felt, when I was waiting there for something
to happen, and nothing did. I was thinking
that those Germans, waiting for that mine
to explode and send us all into Eternity,
must have felt somewhat the same way as
I did.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh!” George Harper grunted, in deep
disgust. But Tom and Ollie burst into
laughter which was none the less uproarious
if suppressed by the necessities of their
present situation; and their merriment was
not so much at the predicament of the Germans,
if the truth be told, as in the mischievous
delight they took in the increased
misery with which Harper heard this oft’
repeated tale of his mistake in that Brighton
relay race.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Think you’re smart Alecks, both of you,
don’t you?” Harper growled, from the depths
of his blanket, while distinct gasps of amusement
continued to come from Tom and
Ollie as they wrapped themselves in theirs;
but a few moments later all three were sleeping
as soundly and as peacefully as though
nothing more serious than the story just told
had disturbed the quiet routine and happiness
of their lives.</p>

<p class='c013'>And thus, too dog-tired even for dreams,
as oblivious to all that was going on about
them as they were themselves for the time
completely forgotten by the officers and men
of their own company, they slept on and on,
hour after hour, unmindful and unknowing
that overhead—above the dark and hidden
hole in which they lay unheeded—their own
advance army had moved out, and entirely
vanished in pursuit of the enemy; the whole
American movement pushing forward, circling
about them, leaving them alone, forgotten,
abandoned.</p>

<p class='c013'>The afternoon was well on the wane when
Tom Walton, falling into a dream of that
foot race which had been the subject of their
conversation just before they slumbered off,
awoke panting and as breathless as though
in fact he had just run a mile in record-breaking
time.</p>

<p class='c013'>For a moment he looked about the dark
cavern dazedly, unable to remember where
he was or why he was there. Then slowly it
began to dawn upon him that he had been
asleep for a long time, and he rose hurriedly,
throwing his blanket aside and hurrying up
the short ladder to the outside world above.</p>

<p class='c013'>What he saw almost took his breath away.
The thousands of men who had been there
when he and his two companions turned in
for their much-needed sleep were nowhere
to be seen. The land all about was a shell-torn
desolation. Here and there lay corpses
as grim reminders of the awful struggle which
had marked the taking of what once had been
the town of Thiaucourt; but so far as Tom
could see there was not a sign of life anywhere—except
 that which was betokened in
the dull booming of guns far, far to the northward.</p>

<p class='c013'>Shouting to awaken George and Ollie, he
descended part way into the dug-out.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Up, slackers!” he called, still rubbing
the sleep out of his own eyes, scarcely able
as yet to fully comprehend the truth of the
situation.</p>

<p class='c013'>As the other two lads raised tousled heads
inquiringly out of the warm depths of their
blankets, peering at him blankly as exhausted
persons do in that first instant of suddenly
being brought back to wakefulness, Tom
was up and out of the dug-out again, taking
a second survey of the scene, reviewing the
events which had preceded their turning in,
casting about in his still muddled mind for
some explanation of the surprising situation
he found himself and his friends in.</p>

<p class='c013'>What had happened? Why hadn’t they
been summoned to join their company whenever
and wherever it went? A score of such
questions chased each other through his mind,
to be capped with the utterly disconcerting
one—which way had the American army gone?
Had it advanced, even beyond sight and
sound, or had it—had it been compelled to
retire?</p>

<p class='c013'>For an instant Tom shivered as though he
suddenly had been struck by a chilling wind,
but in another he had regained his assurance
and confidence, for did not the booming of
the guns to the north indicate beyond question
that there the battle raged anew—that
in the quick advance they had been forgotten
and left there to sleep away their fatigue?</p>

<p class='c013'>Of course! And thus Tom quickly summed
up the situation for his two surprised friends
when they emerged from the dug-out to
demand excitedly the whys and the wherefores
of their sudden awakening.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Apparently the whole army that was in
this section has gone ahead for two or three
miles,” Tom told them briefly. “We were
overlooked, which is a good warning that we
should not place too great a value upon
ourselves, or overestimate our own importance.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But when,” demanded George Harper,
excitedly, “when did all this happen? I
didn’t hear anything.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nor I,” added Ollie, not without a sense
of humor, even in the most trying situation,
“and yet the evidence is pretty conclusive.
Apparently it did happen, and right effectively,
too.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” Harper admitted slowly, and then
added: “I wonder whether we’d be classed
as deserters or deserted?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I feel like I did the day of that race,
when I—” Ollie began, but the rest was lost
as he dodged suddenly to escape a well-aimed
kick from the irritated Harper.</p>

<p class='c013'>It required Tom’s diplomacy to restore
peace and calm consideration of what they
were to do in the situation confronting them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Only one thing to it, as I see it,” said
George Harper at last, “and that is to head
out toward the sound of those guns and just
keep on until we come up with some of our
own men.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, just keep on going, that’s you,”
Ollie answered, his mischievous nature again
cropping out. “But how about your sense
of direction?”</p>

<p class='c013'>A tart reply which Harper already had
phrased upon his lips remained unsaid as he
abruptly pointed upward to where a big
aeroplane was approaching them from out
of the north. They stood silent as it came
swiftly and majestically down the wind toward
them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“An American,” Tom announced at last,
when able to make out the markings on the
machine. “Wish he’d come down and give
us our bearings.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems as if he was thinking of that himself,”
said Ollie, as the ’plane nosed downward
in its approach. “Maybe he’s got some
engine trouble and is going to make a landing.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Changed his mind,” Harper remarked, as
the machine passed over them, took an upward
tack again, then at a higher altitude
began circling about them. “Looks as though
he was sort of sizing us up. Tom, why not
signal him?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Acting upon the suggestion, Tom, who
was the only one of the three who could talk
in the arm signalling code, began to reveal
their identity, while if the maneuvers of
the aeroplane were significant, those in it
looked on with interest.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Americans seeking our own lines,” Tom
spelled out with quick upward and outward
jerks and sweeps of both arms.</p>

<p class='c013'>The three youths waited for something
that might be taken as an acknowledgment
or reply, but none came, or, if it did, they
were too far away to see it; and a moment
later the machine swept to the eastward,
swooped down so close to the ground that for
a time it was completely lost to sight behind
a nearby wood, then rose again and taking
a wide swerve east and north finally disappeared
entirely.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s polite, anyway, whoever he is,”
Ollie commented as they gave up hope of
the pilot having any intention of returning
to them. “He might at least have dropped
us a biscuit or two.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Which reminds me that I’m pretty hungry
myself,” admitted Tom Walton.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ravenous, better describes my awful
emptiness,” said Harper, “and I don’t see
any hope of eats around here. Let’s get
started.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They descended together into the dug-out
to roll their blankets and get their equipment,
but they were not to move on just
then with the freedom they had expected.</p>

<p class='c013'>The aeroplane, camouflaged as an American
machine, had done some signalling, too,
but not to the boys from Brighton. Its
mission in descending almost to earth behind
the wood had been to make the presence of
the Americans known to a small detachment
of Germans which somehow had escaped
detection in remaining there, and which had
been waiting for darkness to fall, in order to
make an effort to skirt the long American
lines and join their own, further on.</p>

<p class='c013'>And while Sergeant Tom Walton and Privates
Ollie Ogden and George Harper were
down in the dug-out, totally ignorant of
what was going on above, half a dozen of
these Germans had crept up and concealed
themselves in positions most advantageous to
the capture of the Americans.</p>

<p class='c013'>The three youths had not moved fifty feet
from the dug-out when without the slightest
warning, or time in which to fight back, they
found themselves entirely surrounded, a bayonet
point jabbing the stomach and back of
each of them.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was absolutely nothing they could
do but surrender, and this they did at the
command of the officer in charge,—a lieutenant
of cavalry, as the lads noted from his
uniform and insignia.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A fine mess we’re in now,” Tom ejaculated,
as their guns were taken from them
and they were instructed to march ahead
of their captors.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wonder where we’re bound for?” Ollie
whispered in reply.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Some place where they’ve got some eats,
I hope,” George Harper summed up, and as
the first shadows of night began to fall they
were herded into the Germans’ hiding place,
where they found a dozen more Huns.</p>

<p class='c013'>Preparations of some sort were going forward,
but to the extreme disappointment of
the famished youths it was apparent that it
was not for the serving of food. And it was
not long before they became aware that
they were in for what looked like a long and
fatiguing march, although they had not eaten
for many hours.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” said Ollie, when that matter seemed
settled beyond all hope or doubt, “we ought
to be glad they didn’t shoot us, anyway.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The sharp glance of a German near them
was sufficient to warn them against any
further conversation.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch14' class='c007'>CHAPTER XIV <br /> <br /> <span class='sc'>John Big Bear—Scout</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_45_0_65 c012'>BY short stretches the Germans and
their three American prisoners had
been pushing forward now for nearly
two hours. The Huns were not in ignorance
of their own danger of capture, and their
progress was made with the utmost caution,
the major number, with Tom, Ollie and
George, forming a central party, ahead of,
behind and on either side of which scouts
reconnoitered constantly to avoid contact
with American outposts.</p>

<p class='c013'>Even in the silence and secrecy that was
necessary in that cautious advance, the American
youths had more than a taste of Hun
treachery and brutality. Apparently the
Germans knew that their prisoners were
hungry, from having overheard their remarks
immediately after their capture. They were
made aware of their parched thirst when
the lads asked for water.</p>

<p class='c013'>And to aggravate their misery so far as
possible, although the lads were too proud
to let it be seen that the acts even annoyed
them, the Germans, singly and in pairs,
would walk directly in front of or beside
them, munching thick slices of their own
brutal-looking brown, or rather black, bread,
or thrust the opening of a water bottle to
the lips of one of them, only to withdraw it
quickly with a low laugh when the youths
thus sorely tempted would try to get at least
a swallow of the craved water.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They’re barbarians; they are without
human instincts or feelings,” Tom hissed
into the ear of Ollie, who walked in the
middle of the trio, “so try not to mind anything
they do. Our best course is to ignore
what they do in their efforts to punish us,
and to avoid aggravating them any further.”</p>

<p class='c013'>At that moment Harper stumbled over a
fallen tree branch and fell to the ground,
splintering and crashing the dead wood.</p>

<p class='c013'>A gutteral oath just behind him was accompanied
by a sharp bayonet jab in the
ribs. Harper was about to let out an involuntary
cry of mingled pain and anger
when Tom, who well enough knew the result
would be more punishment, cautioned him,
“Say nothing.” The Boche, who did not
understand English, peered at the sergeant
inquiringly through the darkness, but as
Harper got up he did nothing worse than
give him a vigorous shove forward.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were now closely skirting a long fringe
of wood that seemed to run almost directly
northeast and southwest, and even the men
who were stretched out ahead and on either
side as “feelers” for the American forces
kept well within its shadows, for the rising
moon was bathing the whole countryside
in its light, and objects, particularly if they
were moving, could be discerned at a considerable
distance. Occasionally they came
upon the body of a dead soldier, the stark
and staring eyes acquiring an added touch
of ghastliness in the pale lunar light.</p>

<p class='c013'>Occasionally the dull hum of an aeroplane
motor would be heard in the distance, its
sound rising to a roar as it approached and
passed, but practically all the time it was
within hearing the small band of Germans
remained in hiding among the trees, and
although sometimes the lads could see the
machines so plainly that it seemed they might
attract attention to themselves with a shout,
they never were discovered by the pilots or
their observers.</p>

<p class='c013'>As this continued, and the distance covered
made it seem as though they must now
be paralleling, if not actually already by, the
American lines, the youths became more and
more depressed. The aeroplanes passed above
them without knowing they were there, and
thus far not a single American patrol had
been encountered. The outlook was not
encouraging. It began to look as though
Tom Walton, George Harper and Ollie Ogden
were to be ushered out of hostilities and into
a German prison camp for the duration of
the war.</p>

<p class='c013'>Without a spoken word, but in glances as
eloquent as any speech, the young men
questioned one another as to the possibilities
of escape; but though each cast about
desperately in quest of what might look like
the slightest promise or the smallest opportunity,
none presented, and the three
tramped on, striving to go along so quietly
and unobtrusively as to allay all suspicion
upon the part of their captors that they
might even be contemplating escape. Each
felt that if they could succeed in this, then
the Germans might become less watchful,
and perhaps, later on, when the Huns were
more weary with their tramp and constant
caution of attracting attention to themselves,
they might drop behind and not be
missed until they had made good their escape.</p>

<p class='c013'>Optimism is an American characteristic,
but particularly it prevails in the happy,
care-free, sturdy American youth, and these
three lads were of the sturdiest stock and
could trace their forebears back to Revolutionary
times.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is good, too, that invariably with optimism
goes courage and self-possession, or
Sergeant Tom Walton might have gasped
out his astonishment, or cried out in involuntary
consternation, when he happened to
glance upward just as a Boche in front of
him struck a match to light his pipe.</p>

<p class='c013'>There in the branches of a tree just above
him, almost near enough for him to have
touched it with a slight jump, a face peered
down at him!</p>

<p class='c013'>It was all in the space of a few seconds,
but as the man there in the branches stared
back at him, not a muscle of his countenance
moving, his eyes blinking ever so slightly
from the sudden flare of light from the match,
Tom recognized in that swarthy personage
one whom he knew—a man of iron strength,
of indomitable will, of almost uncanny ability
in following a trail—John Big Bear, Indian
scout for Uncle Sam, one time crack rider
and dead shot with Buffalo Bill’s Wild West!</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom Walton could have shouted then and
there from sheer happiness, for he recognized
in John Big Bear the equal in strength,
courage and swiftness of action, of any six
Germans who could be picked from the
Kaiser’s crack Prussian Guards. But instead
of shouting, or even by any other utterance or
slightest sign, permitting John Big Bear’s
proximity to become known, Tom simply
flashed back a look of understanding, to which
John Big Bear vouchsafed but the slightest
nod, and then the match went out, darkness
again closed them in, and the Indian scout
was left to the rear, still perched in the tree
to which evidently he had climbed the better
to observe the numerical strength of the
enemy he had heard approaching.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was perhaps a hundred yards further
on, and while they were still hugging closely
to the shadows of the wood, that Tom had
an opportunity, a few quickly whispered
words at a time, to impart a knowledge of
what he had observed to Ollie. And a little
later Ollie, by the same guarded process,
informed George Harper.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were now prepared for any eventuality,
for they felt absolutely certain that
John Big Bear, to whom all three had been
friendly on more than one occasion, never
would permit them to be taken prisoners to
the German lines without some brave effort
at rescue.</p>

<p class='c013'>The question agitating the minds of the
three lads was whether he would attempt
this alone, or by assistance which he might
procure from the nearest detachment of
Americans.</p>

<p class='c013'>Knowledge of John Big Bear’s nature
made it more than an even supposition that
he would try it without going far afield for
other assistance, and especially did the lads
believe this to be true now that he was certain
that they knew of his proximity; for
once he launched his plan, whatever it might
be, he could count upon their assistance to
carry it through.</p>

<p class='c013'>Naturally, therefore, they were keenly on
edge, and at the slightest untoward sound,
even so slight that the Germans themselves
did not seem to notice, they were ready either
for a wild dash for liberty, a running fight,
or a man-to-man struggle right upon the spot.</p>

<p class='c013'>But the lads themselves, expectant as they
were, hardly were prepared for the wily
Indian warfare of John Big Bear.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were in a particularly shadowed spot
when Tom thought he heard the slightest
grunt, or it might have been a suppressed
hiccough, from the German not two feet
away from him and acting as their guard
upon the right. There wasn’t anything at
all unusual about the sound. Tom turned a
merely casual glance in that direction, and
but for a slight nudge from a lithe form
which had carried the German speechless
and motionless to the ground, he would have
come to a sudden halt.</p>

<p class='c013'>John Big Bear was at work! And already
he had disposed of one Boche—or was at
that instant disposing of him—and without
a single one of the other Germans realizing
that anything had happened.</p>

<p class='c013'>As Tom continued on he managed to cast
one sidelong glance at the two forms locked
together upon the ground. With his powerful
left hand John Big Bear, trusty scout for
Uncle Sam, had the German in a throat
stranglehold, and before the under man
could begin to writhe free, or so much as
utter a groan, a knife which the Indian held
in his uplifted right hand descended with
tremendous force and unerring aim.</p>

<div id='i182'  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/p182.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='sc'>With His Powerful Left Hand John Big Bear had the  German in a Throat Stranglehold.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Tom knew that the Hun had died instantly
and with only a flash of pain as the steel
blade penetrated his heart!</p>

<p class='c013'>Instinctively, rather than by any sound
he heard, Tom knew that John Big Bear, as
silently as the wild animals he had stalked
years before in his native woods in the great
northwest of the United States, was approaching
again. He gave Ollie the barest nudge,
and he in turn relayed the warning to Harper.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom felt a slight touch upon his arm. It
was startling, even uncanny, to know that a
man could move so silently and stealthily
that he might be right beside one and his
presence remain unknown until he, himself,
revealed it. In the darkness the Indian
pressed a finger against Tom’s lips, then put
the automatic pistol which had been the
German’s into his hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wait!” was the one word he barely
breathed into Tom’s ear, and the latter knew
he was only to use the firearm when John
Big Bear directed. And he was entirely content
to trust to John Big Bear’s judgment in
such an emergency as this.</p>

<p class='c013'>A moment later the German who had been
stalking along beside George Harper, as the
guard on the left, went the way of the Hun
before him. Like a panther the Indian leapt
upon him, strangling the breath from him
and swiftly bearing him to the ground at the
same time, and all so silently that no one
else was the wiser.</p>

<p class='c013'>Each of the lads realized what they had
not before—that it was a crafty determination
to learn all that could be taught him about
his own work in life, and not any lack either
of strength or agility, which had caused the
Indian time and again to go down to apparent
defeat in wrestling matches with a powerful
and practiced Japanese athlete who was a
member of Company M in their same regiment.</p>

<p class='c013'>This Jap, descendant of a race of men noted
for their agility and wrestling ability, their
strength and suppleness and cat-like quickness,
was an acknowledged peer of that mat,
even among men of his own nationality, but
more than once, after he had thrown John
Big Bear only with the most evident effort,
the lads had seen him look at the Indian in a
silent questioning way, unconsciously shaking
his head ever so slightly.</p>

<p class='c013'>The truth was, as they learned later, he
had sensed that John Big Bear, did he care
to, could have proved himself more than a
match even for this expert wrestler, for the Indian
was bigger, stronger, equally as quick and
lithe and agile. And in the last match they
had seen between the two, the Indian had
rapidly bent and twisted, side-stepped and
squirmed until he had just the hold upon the
Jap which so many times he had studied the
Jap getting upon him, and then, as though
his opponent was a mere child, he had lifted
him into the air and placed him, impotent
and shoulders squarely down, upon the mat.</p>

<p class='c013'>The gleam in the eyes of the Jap as he rose
was not that of hatred or revenge, but rather
of good sportsmanship, mingled with a look
that told of a suspicion confirmed. John Big
Bear had been learning every trick that the
Jap knew, without once revealing any of his
own; and the Jap realized that except by
accident he never would throw the Indian
in a serious contest again.</p>

<p class='c013'>These were the tactics that were being
brought to bear now upon the helpless, unsuspecting
Germans, and one at a time they
were being rendered forever hors-de-combat
and relieved of their weapons which in turn
were handed over to the three lads.</p>

<p class='c013'>But if John Big Bear was strong, able and
self-confident, so also was he daring, as he
proved beyond all doubt that night.</p>

<p class='c013'>Having disposed in quick succession of the
three Huns who were nearest the three youths,
and who had been acting as their guards, the
Indian was able to whisper something into
their ears which made their hearts beat a
little faster in startled surprise and admiration.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No kill ’em all,” John Big Bear muttered
in a low tone. “Take ’em prisoner like ’em
took you. Show ’em heap big s’prise party.
Show ’em American kill if want, take prisoner
if want. Take ’em in, show ’em Heap Big
White Chief Persh.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The lads waited in awed silence for John
Big Bear to make further revelations of his
plan. All this time they were walking the
same measured step as though nothing at
all had occurred.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Maybe kill ’em lieutenant,” the Indian
continued. “Anyway get ’em uniform on
me. Lead ’em to American lines. You follow.
No get by you. See?”</p>

<p class='c013'>The lads did see. John Big Bear somehow
was going to get into the German lieutenant’s
uniform, without any of his men realizing
the substitution, and lead them directly into
the American lines, with their supposed
prisoners bringing up the rear to prevent
their escape.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You know whistle?” John Big Bear
asked, by way of indicating the signal he
would give, when attired in the uniform and
taking over the leadership of the German
officer.</p>

<p class='c013'>They had heard it before. It was a sound
like that of some distant bird crying in a
wood. No one would suspect it came from
a point less than half a mile away. John
Big Bear was a ventriloquist in that respect.</p>

<p class='c013'>The march continued. Within fifteen minutes
they heard the distant, dismal bird-call
that signalled that now John Big Bear was
leading the Germans in the guise of their
lieutenant. A moment later they left the
edge of the wood and struck out into the
open. The lads saw one of the Germans try
to approach the man he thought to be his
officer. John Big Bear waved him back
imperiously. The march continued.</p>

<p class='c013'>Twenty minutes more elapsed when suddenly,
in a spot which the glare of the moon
made almost as light as day, and just when
some of the Huns had noticed the decrease
in their number, John Big Bear swung about,
an automatic in either hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stick ’em up,” he cried, and his manner
was so menacing that the Germans, whether
they understood the order or not, after one
glance behind them, which showed them
their erstwhile prisoners as their actual captors,
were so dumbfounded that they did not
even attempt resistance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Take ’em guns,” the Indian ordered, and
Ollie Ogden carried out the instruction with
alacrity.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A regular arsenal,” he commented, as he
gathered in the last weapon and divided the
burden with Tom and George.</p>

<p class='c013'>John Big Bear marshaled the Germans
into a double file line.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Heap step,” he shouted abruptly, and
again the Germans responded as though the
Indian vernacular was their method of daily
intercourse.</p>

<p class='c013'>They stepped—and at such a lively rate
that in another ten minutes the startled
challenge of a sentry informed them that
they were within the American lines.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Got ’em heap fool prisoners,” was John
Big Bear’s response to the sentry’s demand;
but the man was a member of the same company
with the Indian, knew his voice, his
value and his idiosyncrasies. He peered just
long enough to make certain that it was
John Big Bear, with a batch of Boche prisoners,
and then summoned the corporal of
the guard.</p>

<p class='c013'>The colonel in charge of that particular
section of the front was passing at the time,
heard the call and stepped over. In a very
few seconds he had gathered what had taken
place.</p>

<p class='c013'>He started to commend John Big Bear.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ugh!” the Indian interrupted, at the
same time walking away, as though the colonel
was nothing more than another private
in the ranks, “Not hard ketch ’em. German
big wind, no fight. Heap fool.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And thus John Big Bear dismissed the incident
and strode to the quiet of a well-earned
rest.</p>

<div class='pbb'>

</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch15' class='c007'>CHAPTER XV <br /> <br /> <span class='sc'>The Struggle Under the Water</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_6_0_65 c012'>AS John Big Bear stalked away without
even so much as saluting the commander
of the regiment, the colonel
stood gazing after him reflectively, the suspicion
of a smile twitching at the corners of
his mouth. There were several things the
colonel might have done, for John Big Bear’s
action distinctly came within the official
definition of unbecoming conduct, even insubordination.</p>

<p class='c013'>But after all it is often not so much the
act itself that counts, as the motives behind
it; and whereas such conduct as the Indian’s
might have been deliberate disobedience in
one of a different nature, the colonel, who
knew men, and who particularly knew the
hidden courage and devotion of John Big
Bear, merely looked after the Indian as he
strode away, muttering something under his
breath which, as Ollie Ogden caught it, was
far from suggesting the guard house or a
court martial.</p>

<p class='c013'>The boys were standing aside, waiting to
learn where their own company was stationed,
and the colonel had turned for a
moment to speak to another officer who had
come up.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A fighter from the ground up,” Ollie
heard him say, undoubtedly referring to
John Big Bear.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” the other man replied, “the only
trouble I have is in holding him in restraint.
He constantly wants to go out and clean up
the whole German army himself. I must
say he hasn’t much respect for the Huns.
I believe a dozen men like him could demoralize
a whole Boche regiment.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And the lads became aware for the first
time that the speaker was their own captain.
They saw, too, that he carried his left arm
in a sling. A pang went through them as
they realized the action their own company
must have been in that day while they were
sleeping in the dug-out under Thiaucourt;
but the thought also brought with it all that
they had accomplished, and though not disposed
to flatter themselves, they felt, and
justifiably so, that on every occasion they
had fulfilled their duty whenever and in
whatever guise it presented itself.</p>

<p class='c013'>The colonel and captain, who had been
conversing in low tones, turned and approached
the three lads. The captain recognized
them for the first time.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, well,” he exclaimed. “Here you
are, apparently well and sound, and we
thought the three of you were gone. Have
you been with another unit? Just arrived
I see. What’s the report, sergeant?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Briefly, but clearly, Tom explained everything—how
they had slept on while squads
and companies and battalions and regiments
and brigades and even the entire division
moved out; how they had awakened to find
themselves alone; of their capture by the
twenty Germans, and later, under the leadership
of John Big Bear, of their turning the
tables on those of the Germans who remained
living after the Indian got through his work.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sergeant Tom Walton did not spare himself
or his two pals in what looked to them
like unforgivable carelessness in having slept
so soundly that a whole army moved out over
their heads without their having heard a
sound; neither did he seek to embellish the
account of their later daring accomplishment.</p>

<p class='c013'>The colonel and captain listened in silence
until the report was concluded, but the lads
found no censure awaiting them. The colonel
nodded his head approvingly and again called
the captain aside. They conversed for several
minutes, apparently giving grave consideration
to some important project, and then
called the youths over.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Our company has been pretty well shot
to pieces, boys,” the captain began, “but
the success of this entire drive of course
depends upon the manner in which every
unit carries through its especial mission.
And ours is a difficult one tonight. The men
have been fighting all day, and those who
are not dead or wounded are so utterly exhausted
that they hardly can be asked or
expected to do anything further tonight.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The colonel was gazing at them intently.
The captain paused for a moment. The
young men remained at rigid attention,
waiting to learn what new service or sacrifice
lay before them. Tired as they were, they
knew that they had rested and slept since
other members of the company had, and that
they had not endured the awful conflict of
the day, under which hundreds of their friends
had gone down. And besides, there was
something exhilarating and thrilling in receiving
some commission directly from the captain,
in the presence, and undoubtedly with
the approval, of the commander of the regiment.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We are not more than a quarter of a mile
from a swift but narrow river,” the captain
continued, pointing off to the right, “but we
were unable to get further before darkness.
Most of the enemy are on the other side, but
a strong rear guard is holding the near bank.</p>

<p class='c013'>“To properly lay our plans for the morning
it is necessary that we have some definite
idea of whether the Germans have decided
to make a determined stand here, or whether
the main force is retreating beyond the other
side of the stream, leaving only this comparatively
small guard to harry and delay our
advance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As I have said, our men are exhausted.
It is necessary that we send out scouts to
reconnoiter. You men already have gone
through a great deal that has earned you the
respect and admiration and commendation
of your officers. Do you feel that you can
go forward on the difficult and dangerous
mission that I have outlined? I would send
John Big Bear with you, but he has been
through enough in the last forty-eight hours
to kill an ordinary man. Are you men prepared
to take up this necessary task?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We are,” the three young soldiers answered
in unison, and at the same instant
from out of the darkness behind them came
a deep grunt and John Big Bear stepped
forward.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Young ’em fellas go; me go, too,” the
Indian announced briefly</p>

<p class='c013'>John Big Bear had been listening! The
captain swung on him suddenly, his lips
already framing a reprimand, when he caught
the colonel’s eye. The latter merely gave an
almost imperceptible nod of his head, and
the captain at once changed his tactics.</p>

<p class='c013'>“John Big Bear,” he announced, as though
it had been he instead of the Indian who had
decided the question, “you and Sergeant
Walton and Harper and Ogden are assigned
to report upon the approximate strength of
the enemy forces on the opposite bank of the
river, and also whether they are preparing
to make a stand there, or are moving on.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The four men saluted and a moment later
were lost in the darkness. It was not until
they were crawling well within the enemy
outposts that they remembered that with the
exception of John Big Bear, who had equipped
himself with a regulation automatic and
plentiful ammunition, the others had only
what cartridges were in the revolvers they
had taken from the Germans.</p>

<p class='c013'>And it was almost at that instant that an
alert sentry discovered their presence. He
fired point blank from a distance of not more
than fifty feet, and Ollie Ogden felt the
bullet whistle by his head.</p>

<p class='c013'>Bang! It was John Big Bear’s unerring
aim, and the Boche was laid low. But in
that moment a dozen of the enemy suddenly
rose into sight, and there was but one course
open—a running fight toward the river bank,
for the position of the Germans was such that
retreat to the American lines was cut off,
even had the four men been disposed to turn
back.</p>

<p class='c013'>Just as they reached the edge of the river
a suppressed grunt from John Big Bear indicated
that he had been hit, but he did not go
down.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In big water,” he shouted to the others,
and with a simultaneous splash they dived
into the river.</p>

<p class='c013'>All were excellent swimmers, but as they
came up close together, far out in the stream,
the outlook was far from encouraging. The
bank from which they had jumped was lined
with hostile men, and directly approaching
them was a boat containing at least half a
dozen others, evidently engaged in ferrying
back and forth, gradually depleting the rear
guard which had been left upon the American
side.</p>

<p class='c013'>With one long breath the four men dived
again, but not before Tom had noticed that
John Big Bear was swimming only with his
right arm, his left seemingly out of commission.</p>

<p class='c013'>When they came to the surface again they
were above the boat, which was a raft-like
affair, but still at a point between it and the
American side. Before their whereabouts
had been discovered John Big Bear had formulated
a plan and in a few swift words imparted
it to his companions.</p>

<p class='c013'>Inhaling all the air they could, in order to
remain under water as long as possible, they
dived for the third time. The three lads
swam with all their strength down stream
and ahead of the Indian, to a point just behind
the boat.</p>

<p class='c013'>There, until it seemed that their lungs would
burst, they waited. Unable to stay down
longer, each struck out again for the top.
They lifted their heads into the air not ten
feet below the boat, and just at an instant
when, if the situation had not been so serious,
they could have laughed outright.</p>

<p class='c013'>John Big Bear, giant of a man that he was,
with the strength of a Sampson despite his
wounded left arm, had come up unsuspected
on the upper side of the boat, and, despite
the weight of the men in it, had with one deft
and tremendous upward push turned it over.
Or, to be exact, with the men all lined up on
the opposite side, waiting to take pot shots at
the swimmers when they came up where they
thought they must, he was just in the act
of turning it over, with their unconscious
assistance, when the lads came up for air.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Germans had neither time nor thought
for shooting then. It all had happened so
suddenly, as most things did that were
engineered by John Big Bear, that they
were seized with consternation as they hurtled
headlong into the river.</p>

<p class='c013'>Each of the lads had his gun ready, butt end
outward, for the struggle that must
ensue. John Big Bear, working with one
arm and shoulder, as he had to, was having
all he could do to right the boat again.</p>

<p class='c013'>There were shouts from the American side
of the bank which indicated that another
raft loaded with men was trying to put out.
A Boche came up beside Tom Walton, gave
one wild stare at him and dived again, just
as Tom’s revolver butt hit the water with a
resounding splash. Ollie at that moment
was struggling in the grasp of a gigantic
Hun. With three quick strokes Tom was
beside them. He managed to hit the enemy
a terrific blow over the head, which released
Ollie, but a moment later it was George
Harper who had to come to Tom’s rescue as
a German who had dived under him dragged
him gasping and breathless, below the surface.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some of the Germans had fled down stream
as fast as their swimming abilities could carry
them, but enough had stayed to make it a
terrible struggle, with all the odds upon the
enemy side.</p>

<p class='c013'>Firing had ceased on the bank when it
was seen that Americans and Germans were
all mixed up together in the water, but no
sooner had John Big Bear righted and crawled
into the boat than bullets began to whiz
around his head.</p>

<p class='c013'>This angered John Big Bear, and it’s bad
business to get an Indian mad. He is likely
to do some damage. John Big Bear was no
exception to his race.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lying flat in the boat, he leveled his revolver
over its side. Pop! And a Boche
who twice had nearly drowned Ollie Ogden
went down to a watery grave. The sight so
disconcerted the other Huns who had seen
it that they immediately dived. John Big
Bear’s gun continued to speak as one by
one they came to the surface again. Instantly
all dived. The lads saw only two finally
reappear. Whether the others had been
killed or drowned, or had made their escape
in the darkness, they never knew.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nor did they much care. It had been the
most exhausting experience they ever had
been through, and as they climbed into the
boat which John Big Bear managed to maneuver
to them, and each laying to the oars
struck out with all their strength for a point
of safety down stream, they were thankful
enough to have escaped alive.</p>

<p class='c013'>A bullet had smashed John Big Bear’s
shoulder, and all were half frozen from the
icy water and chilling winds. But they had
learned that for which they had been sent.
The rear guard left on the American side
of the stream was rapidly being ferried to
the opposite side, and no shots worth speaking
of had come at them from there. Undoubtedly
the Germans were continuing a hasty
retreat under cover of the night.</p>

<p class='c013'>And with all the strength they had remaining
in them, after half an hour’s rowing had
brought them to a place of safe landing, the
lads ran back into the mainland, to report to
their commander and get hot coffee and into
dry clothes.</p>

<div class='pbb'>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch16' class='c007'>CHAPTER XVI <br /> <br /> <span class='sc'>The Death Dungeon</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c012'>EVEN as the lads had started from the
river’s edge inland to where their own
lines stretched away to seemingly endless
distances south and east, the moon which
had been such a handicap to them in their
sortie against the Germans hid its light behind
gathering clouds, and that which had
developed into a steady drizzle before they
reached their company’s quarters was now
a veritable downpour as they turned in for
the night.</p>

<p class='c013'>Truly, they were in France! As Ollie remarked
between vigorous tugs at a mud-caked
and water-soaked shoe that was reluctant to
leave an aching foot, it was unbelievable that
it could rain anywhere else with such persistency
and in such quantity.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t know what country is on the
opposite side of the earth from France,” he
said, with a vehemence engendered by the
weather, his shoes and the experiences he
had endured, “but I’ll wager it’s a mighty
fertile land whatever and wherever it is.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hope it grows men who know how to
keep quiet when others want to sleep,” a
deep bass voice grumbled out of the darkness
of a corner which the boys up to that moment
had thought unoccupied.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Buck Granger!” George Harper almost
shouted. “Of all things unexpected! When
did you get back?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Caught up with you again about noon,”
Buck answered drowsily. “They thought
they had me for keeps, I guess, but I’m limping
along all right. I’m back to hand Fritz
something as good as he gave me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The meeting took on the characteristics of
a family reunion, for really the lads had not
realized what a warm spot Buck occupied in
their hearts until he had fallen, as they
thought, mortally wounded, the day before.
And so, despite his sleepy protests, they kept
up a running fire of questions and conversation
for the next ten minutes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” said Buck at last, as though in
retaliation, “now that you’ve about pumped
me dry, suppose I turn the tables and ask
what you fellows have been doing out so
late as this?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Fair enough,” answered Tom laughingly.
But before they were half through telling
him of their experiences of that evening, and
all they had been through since he had last
seen them, Buck was sitting up wide awake
and plying them with interested queries upon
this and that phase of their harrowing escapes
and thrilling captures and adventures.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say!” that energetic youth finally ejaculated.
“I’d have given a whole lot to have
been along.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wish you had been,” said Ollie, with
deep sincerity. “There were times when we
certainly needed you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It means certain and early promotion for
all of you, of course,” Buck went on, “and
promotion is certainly worth striving for;
but it isn’t that so much as just having been
through such things.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The other three lads nodded in silent assent.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just imagine, Tom,” Buck Granger went
on, with increasing enthusiasm, and turning
toward the newly-made sergeant, “just imagine
the yarn that will make for a little
snoozer you’re joggin’ on your knee when
you’re a grandfather, eh?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, look here,” Tom interjected, in a
startled tone.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, that’s all right,” Buck went on.
“You expect to be a grandfather some day,
don’t you, if you get through this all right?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Your mind certainly can cover great distances
in a short stretch of time,” Tom objected
again.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, but that story will make any kid
proud of his grandpap,” Buck continued,
while George and Ollie chuckled at Tom’s
evident discomfort. “Why, that would make
any youngster wish he had been living in
the days of the taming of the Boche, just to
have knocked off a few of them himself.
Yes-sirree!”</p>

<p class='c013'>And when Ollie knew by the sound and
regular breathing on either side of him that
both Tom and George were sound asleep,
and he himself was about dozing off, he heard
Buck mutter, in a self-accusing tone, “By
gosh, I’m an unlucky guy; nothing like that
ever happens to me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then Ollie slept. It could not have been
long thereafter that Buck Granger also drifted
off into the land of sleep, to have this rest
interrupted with vivid dreams of personal
participation in all the incidents that his
three friends had so modestly related to him.</p>

<p class='c013'>What wakened Buck he could not tell, but
he knew it was hours later and that the rain
was still falling and that it was yet dark,
although probably beyond the hour when,
had it been clear, dawn would have been
breaking. But it was not the mystery of
what had wakened him that bothered Buck so
much as it was that terrible feeling that
possessed him—that unexplainable, indefinable
feeling that we all have at times, when
for some unknown reason we feel certain that
something is wrong and we know not what,
or why we feel it so keenly.</p>

<p class='c013'>The four youths were billeted in the small
section that remained standing of what once
had been a cow-shed. Yes, here once had
been a fertile farm, the home and the support
of a thrifty Frenchman and his family. And
now it was a vast shambles and ruin, with
only a part of the cow-shed remaining as
tragic testimony to its earlier estate. Not
very luxurious quarters, you may think! But
real luxury, after all, when compared to water-logged
trenches and rain-soaked, rat-ridden
dug-outs.</p>

<p class='c013'>As Buck first came out of his sound sleep
he was conscious only of the ceaseless, pitiless
hammering of the rain upon the rusted tin
roof of the shed within which he lay—conscious
only of that and of the indefinable
feeling, which he could not overcome, that
something was wrong.</p>

<p class='c013'>And there is nothing that so unpleasantly
grips the mind and the imagination, and
causes the heart occasionally to miss a beat,
as that tense waiting, waiting, waiting which
accompanies a premonition of impending evil
or danger—born of no one knows what—which
comes to one with sudden awakening
in pitch darkness and amid strange surroundings.</p>

<p class='c013'>So it was that even as Buck Granger lay
there, fully aware now of where he was, and
listening to the even breathing of his three
friends who were stretched out not more than
ten feet away from him, something happened
which seemed almost to make the blood
freeze in his veins.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a moan! Weak, subdued, but distinctly
audible, it came from directly beneath
him, as though out of the very ground upon
which he lay.</p>

<p class='c013'>Buck Granger was no coward, but there
are some things which, calmly accepted if not
easily accounted for in the assurance and
self-possession which one feels in daylight,
seem to verge upon the supernatural in the
darkness and mystery of night.</p>

<p class='c013'>The hand which Buck Granger passed
swiftly across his now wide staring eyes was
as cold as ice. For a moment he lay there as
though hypnotized. And then the moan was
repeated, this time so subdued as to be
scarcely audible, but all the more uncanny
for that very fact. With a quick movement
that brought him to his hands and knees,
Buck literally dived across the black space
to where the other three men lay, landing
directly beside Tom Walton.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Tom!” he whispered shrilly into the
latter’s ear. “Tom! Wake up! It’s Buck
Granger! There’s something queer going on
around this shack!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom, who had been partially aroused by
the first mention of his name, came upright
into a sitting posture as Granger spoke
jerkily of the mystery at hand; and he sat
up with such suddenness and force that his
head, striking Buck directly under the chin,
nearly dislocated the latter’s neck and as
narrowly escaped cracking Tom’s skull.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is it? What’s the matter?” the
young sergeant demanded, also in a hoarse
whisper, as they both rubbed their respective
injuries.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Listen!” Buck responded; but there was
no necessity, for just at that instant the moan
was repeated for the third time, now as clear
and distinct as the first time Buck had heard it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Great Scott, that’s wierd,” Tom exclaimed,
almost involuntarily. “What is it?
Who is it? Where does it come from?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t know who or what it is,” Buck
whispered back, “but it seemed to come
right up out of the ground where I was
asleep, and you’re right, it’s wierd enough.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“When did you hear it first?” Tom asked
in a low tone, at the same time cocking his
ear in the darkness for a repetition of the
strange sound.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just a moment ago—heard it twice,”
answered Buck. “Let’s waken the others
and make a light and see what we can find.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom reached into his pocket and drew,
forth an electric searchlight which he immediately
switched on. Their first act was
to squint around in the glare of the light into
every crook and cranny of the little cow-shed,
but there was nothing unusual to be found,
nor was there any further sound.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve always heard that ghosts fade into
thin air and cease all sound when a light
appears,” said Tom, trying to speak lightly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s no such thing as a ghost, as you
and I both know,” Buck responded, resenting
anything that might tend to make him look
foolish. “That groan came from a man,
and whoever he is or wherever he is the
fellow isn’t far away from where we are
right now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the matter with you two, anyway,”
demanded Ollie Ogden, suddenly sitting up
and rubbing his eyes, and at the same time
so disturbing Harper that he too, awakened.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wait a minute or two and you’ll know as
much as we do,” Tom replied.</p>

<p class='c013'>But they did not have to wait that long.
The words had hardly died on Tom’s lips
when something most resembling the sighing
of wind through the bare branches of trees,
but which all four knew to be a human sound,
reached their ears. And just as Buck Granger
had said, it seemed to come from directly out
the ground, at the spot where he had been
sleeping.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom took the pocket searchlight over to
that part of the shed and began an examination.
He laid his ear to the damp earth, but
could hear nothing. Then playing the light
over the ground, he got down upon his hands
and knees for a closer examination. Standing
around him and gazing over his shoulder,
the other three carefully followed his every
move.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was moving around almost in a circle,
when accidentally, in a quick turn, he kicked
a section of the shed wall heavily with the
heel of his boot. He drew up suddenly, and
the other lads crowded closer to him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Didn’t that seem to you to have a peculiar
sound?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It certainly did to me,” George Harper
replied.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Like tapping a rotten watermelon,” said
Buck Granger, in language more descriptive
than elegant.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sounded hollow, anyway,” put in Ollie
Ogden.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s just what I thought,” said Tom,
and to verify their verdict he tapped the
partition again. It gave off the same empty
sort of sound.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, ha!” exclaimed George Harper, leaning
over Tom’s shoulder, and examining the
woodwork above the sergeant’s head. “I
guess this explains it. Looks like some sort
of a secret door.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He had been tracing the outline of a scarcely
perceptible crack which ran from the floor
to a height of about three feet, then across
for two more feet, where it joined another
vertical one which paralleled the first. Also
he had found what anyone might have taken
for a knot-hole at first glance, but which
closer examination showed to have been
made, apparently for the purpose of pulling
the thing open.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Try it again,” Tom suggested, as George,
with one finger crooked into the aperture,
gave it a tug without any seeming result.
“Try it again; I thought it moved a little.”</p>

<p class='c013'>With considerable effort Harper managed
to twist two fingers of his right hand into
the hole, and again gave a sudden jerk; but
the only result was a slight vibration, while
George vigorously rubbed his two pained
digits.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wait a minute,” Ollie suggested, and
going across the shed he picked up a piece of
iron shaped at the end like a stove poker.
“Try this,” he suggested.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let somebody else do it,” said Harper.
“My hand feels as though it was broken.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom took the iron, fixed the end into the
hole and gave a mighty yank. As the secret
door gave way under his weight, Tom suddenly
and unceremoniously and without advance
preparation took a seat on the floor
at the far side of the shed.</p>

<p class='c013'>At any other time his fall might have
caused some merriment, but no one paid
attention to it now. They were too busy
examining a little apparatus in the closet-like
aperture in the wall of the shed, which
now stood exposed to full view. The mechanism
resembled, in fact was almost a replica,
of the dial on the front of a combination safe.
The only difference was that this disc was
marked only with an S at the top, an O at
the bottom, and with a line running part
way around it, near the outer edge, with an
arrow at the bottom end, showing that the
small lever over the dial was always moved
from the top downward to the right, and then
upward on the other side.</p>

<p class='c013'>“S and O,” Tom read off, gazing at the
queer thing as he joined the others. “And
it points to S now. Why, that seems to be
clear. It means ‘shut’ and ‘open.’”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If it’s connected up with any signalling
apparatus a complete revolution of that lever
also might sound an S.O.S.,” suggested Buck
Granger.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Or it might mean ‘slip out’ while the
slippin’s good,” put in Ollie.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, it might mean any one of a thousand
things, such as ‘stop orating’” George Harper
spoke up, impatiently, “but I’m inclined
to believe Tom’s right. Let’s try it, anyway.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom was just reaching for the small lever
when another suppressed moan, unquestionably
from directly beneath their feet, arrested
his hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s someone down there under the
ground,” said Tom, in an awed whisper. “I
believe there’s some connection between that
person and this thing here. I’m going to try
it anyway. Suppose you fellows stand back
there against the opposite wall, in case anything
happens to me when I turn this lever.
And Ollie, you hold the light so that it will
be directly on the dial.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Not knowing what to expect, the three
youths stood with their backs against the
opposite wall, staring at Tom’s hand as the
fingers closed on the lever and he began
turning it toward the mark O, in the direction
the arrow indicated.</p>

<p class='c013'>Slowly he pushed it round until the point
was directly over the O. Tom stepped over
to where the others were, and he was just
in time. There was a sucking sound, such
as is made by drawing one’s boot out of
oozy mud, and then <i>the ground where Buck
Granger had slept began to move upward</i>!</p>

<p class='c013'>The lads stood huddled together. The
ground, which proved to be but a very thin
layer, gave way, and a trap door lifted itself
slowly into the air.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom was the first to move. He stepped
over and peered down into the hole.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Great guns!” he gasped, in a quivering
voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>The others were at his side in an instant.
The sight was a staggering shock to all.</p>

<p class='c013'>There, on the bottom of a black cavern
that apparently extended under the whole
flooring of the cow-shed, lay two bodies.
Both were in French uniforms. Obviously
one man was dead. The other moved slightly
and gave another low moan that showed he
was alive, although not conscious. Three
huge rats scampered away in fright as the
light was thrown upon them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ollie,” said Tom, again taking the leadership,
“you get a surgeon as quickly as you
can. We’ve got to get that fellow out, and
save his life if possible.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Without a word Ollie was gone on the
errand directed, while Tom, holding to the
hands of George Harper and Buck Granger,
lowered himself into the subterranean prison,
the floor of which was not more than five feet
below that of the shed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom turned the living man over so as to
see his face. It was drawn in lines of suffering
and fixed in an expression of absolute terror.
The whole body was emaciated almost beyond
belief.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Poor fellow,” murmured Tom, as he
placed one arm under the shoulders of the
soggy and mildewed uniform. “Left here to
go stark mad and starve to death. Probably
heard death rattle of his companion here
as the rats were gnawing at him.
Ugh!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The man weighed no more than an average
boy of fifteen or sixteen years. Tom raised
the body carefully, lifted it to the height of
the shed floor, and into the hands of the two
youths waiting there. Tom himself was just
climbing out of the pit when Ollie and a
surgeon entered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What have we got here?” the latter asked,
as with businesslike precision he strode to the
still form on the floor, the boys making way
for him.</p>

<p class='c013'>In a few brief words Tom explained—told
how Buck Granger first had been awakened,
then how all of them had heard the moans,
and of the discovery of the secret switch, and
then of the cavern and the bodies within.</p>

<p class='c013'>As Tom spoke the surgeon cast a queer
look at him, but an instant later he was
working over the unconscious Frenchman, a
hand on his pulse, his ear to his heart.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Weak,” he announced at last, “mighty
weak. If he survives it will be because you
men reached him not a moment too soon.
But at that he may be a hopeless lunatic.
We can’t tell about that yet—especially
when a man has gone through what this one
evidently has.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The surgeon again looked down at his
patient. “Why,” he ejaculated suddenly,
“he wears a major’s uniform—infantry, too.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was true. The ghastly ruin of a man
that lay before them once had been a battalion
commander in the French army.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Discovered at last,” the surgeon murmured,
more to himself than the others.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What?” demanded Tom, quickly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The terrible torture prison that we all
have heard about, but never knew how to
locate.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The surgeon paused for an instant as the
unconscious man made a feeble movement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Unquestionably,” he continued, “this is
the Hun chamber of horrors known throughout
the Allied armies—the Death Dungeon.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch17' class='c007'>CHAPTER XVII <br /> <br /> <span class='sc'>John Big Bear Avenges</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c012'>IT was breaking daylight, the rain had
ceased and the sky was clearing when
stretcher-bearers arrived to remove the
unfortunate Frenchman from the squalid
shed which had been the roof of his dungeon
prison.</p>

<p class='c013'>A steady and terrific pounding of the big
guns in the rear had begun. And as though
the first shot had been the signal for general
activity, the vast area occupied by the
American troops became suddenly peopled
with thousands of khaki-clad men. They
swarmed here, there and everywhere, apparently
springing to life and action from
nowhere.</p>

<p class='c013'>The individuals formed into small groups,
and these in turn rapidly mingled with and
became parts of larger units; and thus uninterruptedly
the process continued until, in
the briefest conceivable time and with remarkable
system and precision, and even
before the sun was well above the horizon,
an army had been reassembled and was ready
to follow the creeping barrage which would
be laid down by hidden artillery, as soon as
its present firing had mowed away wire
entanglements and other obstructions which
aerial observers already had reported the
Germans as having left behind them as they
began another day’s retreat.</p>

<p class='c013'>The direction of the firing indicated that
it was along a line stretching far to the northward,
and as time wore on it became apparent
that the extreme upper end was swinging
eastward in a movement of which the section
of line where Company C remained was the
pivotal point. Nor was the object of this
strategy, and the part to be played in it by
those surrounding the pivot, long in doubt.</p>

<p class='c013'>For four miles almost due east of Company
C, the American lines stretched out unbrokenly
where they had smashed back the
southern leg of the St. Mihiel salient. Not
only had this line remained invincible to each
successive effort of the Huns in counter
attack, but it had slowly but steadily advanced
northward, in absolute keeping with
the prearranged schedule by which every unit
was to go forward.</p>

<p class='c013'>This line, and the troops around the pivot
on which the turn was being made, were to
hold firm for a time, and then advance but
slowly, if at all, until it had been fully determined
whether the enveloping movement
being swiftly carried out by the left wing
was a success or failure.</p>

<p class='c013'>If it accomplished its aim, and closed in, or
pocketed, the retreating Germans before they
could make their escape, then but two courses
would remain open to them—suicidal battle,
which must mean ultimate annihilation, or
surrender.</p>

<p class='c013'>The big question of the day was whether
the already routed Germans could get through
the neck of the bottle-shaped line in which
their pursuers now were closing in upon them,
before even that escape was cut off.</p>

<p class='c013'>But if that section of the line in which the
lads were stationed was not to advance at
once, at least no man there was inactive, for
there was more than enough to keep everyone
busy during every moment of the time that
they were waiting for the word that would
send them again into the life and death
struggle in which the contending armies were
engaged.</p>

<p class='c013'>Red Cross units which had not been able
to keep pace with the rapid advance now
were coming up and making ready to go forward
with the first of the doughboys to carry
on the offensive.</p>

<p class='c013'>Trucks in apparently never-ending line were
replenishing the company kitchens, bringing
up more men and munitions; wireless tractors
were pushing to the very front of the
lines to maintain complete communication
between the foremost and division and brigade
headquarters when once the drive in that
sector should begin.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tractors, and mules only a little less powerful,
were bringing forward some of the heavy
guns, new field hospitals were being set up,
and in every department of the great game
of war big preparations were under way.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Doesn’t look as though it was intended
we should loaf around here very long,” said
George Harper to Phil Godwin, another
member of Company C, who came hurrying
up at that moment.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That looks like a pretty safe prediction,”
the other man responded, “but where on
earth have you been. I’ve been hunting you
and Ollie Ogden for half an hour. Major
Barton, down at the hospital, sent me after
you two and Tom Walton. Just found Tom,
but do you know where Ogden is?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Right there,” answered Harper, for Ollie
had at that moment arrived from another
direction and was standing almost directly
behind the man who bore the message.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Major Barton wants to see us at the hospital,”
Harper explained. “I wonder what
he wants us for.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why,” Ollie answered quickly, “Major
Barton was the surgeon who treated that
Frenchman we found under the cow-shed.
Do you suppose it is in reference to that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It must be,” said George, “although at
the time I did not connect the two things.
Do you know where Tom is? The summons
also included him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, just down the line here,” Ollie replied,
at the same time leading the way
toward where Major Barton awaited them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Maybe that poor Frenchman has died,”
was Harper’s comment, after they had told
Tom their own speculations as to the call
for their presence at the hospital.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I sincerely hope not,” said Tom, “although
it wouldn’t be much of a surprise if
he failed to survive such barbarous punishment
as that. He was more dead than alive
when we reached him. By the way, where
is Buck Granger?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Captured,” answered Ollie Ogden, without
an instant’s hesitation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s that?” the other two demanded
of him in unison, coming to an abrupt halt
and turning to face the bearer of this rather
startling news. “What did you say?” Harper
asked again, unable to believe that he
had heard right.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Captured,” Ollie repeated briefly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well holy cats, when and where?” Tom
exploded. “I didn’t know there were any
Germans in this immediate vicinity, except
those who are our prisoners.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t believe there are,” answered Ollie,
making desperate efforts to repress a grin.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look here,” George Harper exclaimed
impatiently, at the same time grasping Ollie
by the shoulder, “quitcherkiddinow, wadayamean,
Buck Granger’s captured?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You talk like a machine gun,” Ollie responded,
sparring for time. “I meant exactly
what I said—Buck was captured.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“When?” Tom Walton demanded.</p>

<p class='c013'>“About an hour ago.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, only a short distance from where I
was.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who captured him?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Ollie made ready for a quick dive away
from the immediate reach of his two companions.</p>

<p class='c013'>“One of the field hospital outfit,” he answered
quickly, at the same time jumping
to safer quarters. “Said he had no business
out for another day or two, with his wound.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Whatever pleasant hostilities Tom and
George may have contemplated were abandoned
with their arrival at that moment at
the place to which Major Barton had summoned
them. They entered in silence, and
the major met them at the door.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m glad you came when you did,” he
greeted them, “but weren’t there four of
you? Where is the other man?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Cap—,” Ollie began, but Tom, with a
quick frown and a surreptitious kick which
made Ollie wince, squelched him before the
word was finished.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Buck Granger is his name, sir,” Tom answered.
“But he was suffering from a slight
wound himself, and he got out earlier than
was intended. They sent him back to the
hospital this morning, to remain for another
day or two.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I see,” Major Barton replied, with the
flicker of a smile playing about the corners of
his mouth for an instant. “Wouldn’t stay
put, eh?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I guess that was about it,” Tom answered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But they captured him,” added the irrepressible
Ollie, and the surgeon joined in the
laugh.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” he said, “I suppose you can
imagine why I sent for you boys. It’s
in reference to that Frenchman you rescued
from the death dungeon. I believe he will
pull through all right, but he is in for a long
siege, and what he needs most, of course, is
nourishment and rest. So, when he responded
to treatment a while ago and regained
consciousness I determined to send him
back to the base hospital, where he will
get just the sort of treatment he requires.
I think he can stand the trip without any bad
results.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But when he realized where he was he
regarded it as nothing less than a miracle,
for he had given up all hope of escape from
his underground prison. He insisted upon
knowing how his rescue had been accomplished,
and as he showed wonderful vitality
and recuperative powers, we told him. When
we informed him we were about to send him
back to a base hospital he insisted that he
see you boys before he went. So, if you are
ready, we will go in.”</p>

<p class='c013'>As they passed down the double row of cots
in the improvised hospital—that mercy station
where men receive first aid before, if their
wounds are sufficiently serious, being sent
back to the base hospital, where better
facilities and attention are possible, they saw
many men whom they knew personally, others
whom they recognized by sight. Brave fellows,
at least temporarily incapacitated for
further battle, they lay there weak and helpless,
smiling wanly and wistfully as the lads,
with a nod and a kindly, cheering word for
each, passed by.</p>

<p class='c013'>When they came to the cot of the Frenchman
they recognized an improvement already.
Hair and beard that had been matted and
tangled had been combed out. He had been
bathed and clothed in fresh linen, and the
mental relief that came with finding himself
safe was reflected in his countenance. But
he was pitifully weak, as the lads realized
when he feebly grasped the hand of each.</p>

<p class='c013'>As the French soldier began to speak, Tom
saw John Big Bear standing just a few feet
away from them, evidently waiting for them,
obviously listening to all that was said. He
had just received a second treatment of his
slight wound in the shoulder.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I never expected to get out of that place
alive,” the Frenchman gasped weakly. “They
tell me I must not talk much, but I wanted
to thank you before they took me away from
here. If it had not been for you lads I probably
would be dead now. The other man
who was in there with me died twenty-four
hours before I lost consciousness, and I could
not have held out much longer.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The man spoke almost perfect English.
And this was explained in his next remark.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I lived for ten years in your country,” he
said, “and now I owe my life to the intelligence
and courage of four of its bravest sons.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He moved restlessly, and the lads saw for
the first time that the four fingers and thumb
of his left hand were gone. He saw them
looking at the disfigured member.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not by a bullet or shell,” he said, by way
of explanation, “but cut off with a hatchet,
one at a time over a period of ten days, by
the same Germans who finally thrust me into
that hole to die. They were enraged because
I refused to give them military information.
They cut off the little finger, and gave me
forty-eight hours in which to think it over.
They repeated the process every two days
until only the hand remained. Why they
did not start in on the other I do not know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The grunt of rage which came from directly
behind the lads caused all to turn, and the
Frenchman to look inquiringly. John Big
Bear had heard enough. He was striding
away toward the door. And while his only
language at the time was a series of deep
grunts, could they have been interpreted
they would have been to the effect that while
his ancestors might have scalped a few
whites, they never cut men’s fingers off to
force a secret, and it was a pity, after all,
that the Indian nation had not survived and
prospered, to scalp every German who had
the slightest warlike disposition.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Our friend,” Tom explained to the mystified
Frenchman. “And a brave and loyal
fellow he is, too, although he seems a trifle
queer to strangers.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The Frenchman nodded, and, seeing the
attendants approaching with a stretcher, to
convey him to the waiting ambulance, he
asked them to remain until he was actually
started away.</p>

<p class='c013'>The lads walked beside the emaciated
officer, and as they emerged through the wide
doorway they saw John Big Bear standing
outside, apparently in deep and unpleasant
meditation.</p>

<p class='c013'>Looking beyond him Tom saw a group
approaching—half a dozen German prisoners
being taken to the rear under two American
soldiers as guards. A moment later and he
realized the first prisoner to be one of those
whom they and John Big Bear had brought
in. His exclamation attracted the Indian’s
attention, and also that of the man on the
stretcher.</p>

<p class='c013'>John Big Bear looked at them without the
slightest change in expression, but the effect
upon the man who had been rescued from
the dungeon was instant and startling.</p>

<p class='c013'>With a cry that was almost a shriek he
pointed at the big German in the lead. The
recognition was apparently mutual, for the
latter’s face went as white as chalk, his step
wavered, and even though it was apparent he
was making a tremendous effort to maintain
his self-possession, his hands shook.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The beast!” the Frenchman shouted, his
weak voice breaking into an hysterical sob.
“It was he—he—who cut off my fingers.
It was he who threw me into that pit to die.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In that tense instant a shot rang out. The
big German crumpled and went down in a
heap without so much as a sound. If anyone
there knew from whence that shot had
come, he made no mention of it, and there
was no investigation.</p>

<p class='c013'>The others gathered about the German who
had gone down, but he had died instantly—shot
directly through the heart. John Big
Bear, with just a perceptible grunt, turned
and walked away.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom Walton, glancing after him, saw the
Indian push something down into his pocket;
that was all. The tortured Frenchman had
been avenged.</p>

  <h2 id='ch18' class='c007'>CHAPTER XVIII <br /> <br /> <span class='sc'>The Death of Snooper Jones</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_6_0_65 c012'>ALTHOUGH what meagre reports there
were to be had indicated that the
long swing of the left wing of the
American army was progressing favorably,
the orders for the big push by the men in the
pivotal sector did not come that day. The
constant roar of the big guns, with occasionally
a big German shell dropping near enough
to do considerable damage, kept them on the
tiptoe of expectancy and ready for any
emergency; but aside from the rather routine
work that falls to men of an army temporarily
at a standstill, and which they were
allowed to do in relays, the men got a longer
and more beneficial rest than they had had
since the drive was inaugurated on September
12th.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the following morning, however, came
orders which cast doubt upon the entire
success of the project of bottling the Germans
up in a pocket of the salient. Had that been
accomplished, the artillery would have
smashed away until the ambushed enemy
either had surrendered or been annihilated.
Instead, came orders to forge ahead with
all speed, and gain contact at the earliest
possible moment.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’re going to chase them clear to the
Rhine this time,” Tom heard one officer say
to another, and indeed the preparations that
had been made, and the manner in which
the orders to move were carried into effect,
made that seem possible, even if not the actual
intention of the present assault.</p>

<p class='c013'>Indeed, the Americans pressing in from
the west, and the French bearing down from
the north, with other Americans bringing an
even stronger upward pressure from the south,
had so thoroughly routed the Hun armies
that they were fleeing precipitately, abandoning
guns and munitions as they went, but
making every effort to so destroy these, as
well as all roads, bridges, etc., that the Allies
might not make use of any of them.</p>

<p class='c013'>And with the enemy thus in costly and
undignified flight, with never a chance to
stop even for a few hours to reorganize, and
with all the boasted discipline and morale
of the German forces destroyed beyond all
hope or possibility of re-establishment, the
Allied commanders were well content for
the time being to conserve their own men
and supplies by vigorously prodding the Huns
in their flight whenever and wherever they
seemed to lag.</p>

<p class='c013'>The orders to go forward came at about
8 o’clock on the second morning. They went
in heavy marching order and with full rounds
of rations. It looked, indeed, as if they were
bound upon a long journey this time, and as
it turned out they were.</p>

<p class='c013'>As they swung off in a cloud of dust—for
the ground had dried out pretty well during
the preceding day—they were preceded overhead
by flocks of scouting aeroplanes. With
them along the roads and through the fields
went trucks loaded with munitions and food,
while behind these came the light artillery,
and, far, far back, the heavies.</p>

<p class='c013'>Two hours march brought them to a point
where the entire army came to a halt while
the scouts and pioneer infantry went ahead to
reconnoitre and destroy the first of the wire
entanglements thrown behind them by the
fleeing Germans.</p>

<p class='c013'>The quick pop of guns and the rattle of
rapid fire as these men approached a thick
wood which lay just ahead was ample proof
that the artillery had not dislodged all of
the Huns, and that snipers and machine
gunners were hidden there as a rear guard
to delay the American advance long enough
to permit the main German army to get
away.</p>

<p class='c013'>The American fire from the north had died
down to little more than an occasional bombardment,
and necessarily directed at a long
angle to prevent shelling the other troops
which were now making the advance.</p>

<p class='c013'>Company C was one of the five units deployed
to attack and take the wood. As the
men started forward the officers in command
of the various companies again gave a warning
which the men had heard repeatedly
before going into an attack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do not touch a dead German for any
purpose whatever.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not that the situation was any
different here from what it had been in other
battles in other places, but the order was
issued as a matter of course and to keep it
fresh in the minds of the advancing men.</p>

<p class='c013'>At no time during the war were the Allied
armies even accused of looting the dead;
but where great masses of men are drawn
together in thousands there are bound to be
exceptions to any rule—men so selfish and
unprincipled that they would place the gratification
of personal desire above the sacred
repute of their army and their country if
they thought they could do so and escape
detection.</p>

<p class='c013'>And the Germans, knowing this, and probably
expecting far more of it from the extent
to which it was done without hindrance or
scruple by their own officers as well as men,
with that cupidity born of vicious minds had
time after time used this very weakness of
men as a means to their sure and sudden
destruction.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the dead of night they would send back
electricians over the field on which a battle
had raged, and, picking out German corpses,
these workers would put cheap but costly-looking
rings and other jewelry upon the
dead men, and then attach these to wires,
through which ran deadly electric currents
as soon as the work was completed and the
trap set.</p>

<p class='c013'>Any man of the opposing army advancing
on the following day who so far succumbed to
the temptation thus deliberately set, as to
attempt to take off any of this seemingly
valuable jewelry, instantly got a death-dealing
shock which invariably threw him
into the air with sparks shooting from his
body, after which he fell to the ground a
seared and scorched and eternally disgraced
corpse himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They haven’t had time to doctor up any
of those bodies along this route,” Ollie Ogden
heard a man just ahead of him mutter, and
looking up he recognized “Snooper” Jones,
so nicknamed because he was constantly
meddling in somebody else’s business and
never attending to his own. He was the
most despised man in the whole regiment for
his lack of pride and patriotism, and knowing
the feeling and lack of respect and esteem in
which he was held, he did not seem in the
least to care.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nobody knew just where “Snooper” Jones’
home was, if he had any, but it was known
that he had been a draft dodger and that he
had been picked up by Government agents
along with half a dozen others of that cowardly
and disreputable character in a raid
conducted one cold night upon the loungers
in a railroad station in one of the large
eastern cities.</p>

<p class='c013'>In other words, “Snooper” Jones, to use a
common expression, had been a bum. He
was a drone bee in the industrial hive of
organized society. He was a waster of his
own time and energy and a burden upon
others. He consumed without producing. He
took, and gave nothing back.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d like to know,” an exhausted and
exasperated lieutenant once had flung at
“Snooper” Jones, “what your aim is in life.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And “Snooper,” consciously or unconsciously
more truthful than he ever had been
known to be before, answered, “I haven’t
any.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The army, that great purifier and energizer
of most men of “Snooper” Jones’
character, had failed to make any visible
change in him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Like the lily,” his top sergeant had said
of him, “he toils not, neither does he spin.
But unlike the lily, he is not good to look
upon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>All of this was passing through Ollie Ogden’s
mind as they tramped along and from time
to time he could hear “Snooper” Jones
grumbling to the men on either side of him,
neither of whom paid the slightest attention
to him, except occasionally to cast upon him
a withering glance of scorn which was at the
same time a storm warning which kept him
silent for a time.</p>

<p class='c013'>Ollie’s contemplations were abruptly cut
short as they seemed suddenly to jump right
into the very maelstrom of battle.</p>

<p class='c013'>In quick succession, as though by a time
clock process, the Germans from their rearmost
heavy guns had planted half a dozen
highly destructive shells right into the ranks
of the advancing Americans, and simultaneously,
as they skirted what they thought an
uninhabited wood, machine gun nests had
opened up a devastating fire upon them.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not until later that they realized
that their quick advance had brought them
directly upon the rear guard of the German
army which, encumbered as it was by the
huge paraphernalia which it carried with it
in its flight, could not move nearly so rapidly
as did the pursuers.</p>

<p class='c013'>The fighting was as bitter as any during
the war, and over ground that already was
littered with the bodies of dead Huns—victims
of terrific shrapnel fire poured into their
lines as they fled.</p>

<p class='c013'>Every inch of ground was bitterly contested
up to the point where the licked Germans
saw it was useless to hold out further. To
silence this fire it was necessary for the Americans
to pick off the snipers and stalk and
capture or demolish the machine gun nests.
Bullets fell about them like hail.</p>

<p class='c013'>Into the very thick of this Tom Walton
and George Harper saw a man rush forth,
rapidly set up a tripod on top of which was a
black box affair, and start turning a crank.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was a moving picture operator, officially
designated with the American Expeditionary
Forces and especially assigned with that
brigade—one of scores of intrepid, courageous
fellows who under circumstances of the greatest
stress seemed to show the greatest calm.
These were the men who were preserving
to future generations the living, moving history
of America’s participation in the World
War, and a dozen times a day when the
panorama of battle was swiftly moving they
fearlessly and without the slightest evidence
of outward concern, risked their lives in the
performance of their duty.</p>

<p class='c013'>Buck Granger once had remarked that this
particular operator must bear a charmed life.
Truly it had seemed so, for time and again
the lads had seen him stand forth, motionless
except for the regular rhythm of his right
hand which turned the crank of the camera—a
challenge and a target for every German
sniper and machine gunner within range.
And yet he had escaped, up to the present,
without a scratch.</p>

<p class='c013'>But here, for the time, the fire was more
concentrated than either Tom Walton or
George Harper ever had seen it before. An
officer shouted to the movie operator to drop
out of sight. But even if the latter heard,
the warning came too late. A shower of
bullets shattered and knocked over the camera,
and in the same instant the operator
himself pitched forward on his face. From
where Tom lay he could see that the man did
not move a muscle, after the first convulsion
which followed his fall. He had been killed
instantly.</p>

<p class='c013'>Officers and men of the ranks were being
picked off mercilessly as they crept forward
to get within reach of the hidden machine
guns. It was at this juncture that another
branch of the service took a hand. It all
showed, too, that the commanding officers
were every instant in close touch with every
changing development of the attack.</p>

<p class='c013'>The order came for the Americans to fall
back several hundred yards. To the mystified
Germans it was a maneuvre not then to be
explained. It was inconceivable that the
Americans should be retreating, and yet
that seemed to be exactly what was taking
place. But the Germans in the wood had their
visions obscured from their own approaching
doom.</p>

<p class='c013'>Up from out of the west, and straight for
a point directly over the natural fort of the
enemy, swooped a dozen heavy bombing
planes. It is doubtful if any German in that
wood ever knew what happened to him. Simultaneously
every plane let go its full cargo
of destruction, and these highly explosive
bombs, descending straight as arrows, struck
the ground at almost the same time, and with
such a detonation as to shake the surrounding
country as though by an earthquake. The
entire wood was demolished. Trees were
lifted from the ground and split to splinters.
Nothing lived there after that work of death
had been carried out. Devastating ruin had
been wrought suddenly and completely. The
ground was torn to great depths and a shower
of wood and rock and other debris was shot
fifty or more feet into the air.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was after they had passed through this
monumental wreckage, and were crawling
forward upon the opposite side, that Ollie
Ogden, intent upon getting around a clump
of bushes so that he could get a view of a sniper
he knew to be hidden there, found himself
but a few yards away from “Snooper” Jones.</p>

<p class='c013'>The latter was edging forward in a declivity
of ground, and for an instant Ollie marveled
at the courage and persistence of the man—but
only for an instant. For looking slightly
ahead, he saw that “Snooper,” thinking himself
hidden from human sight, was crawling
toward the body of a German, his intention
obvious in his every movement.</p>

<p class='c013'>Ollie could not shout a warning without
attracting a concentration of bullets upon his
own position. Unseen by “Snooper” Jones,
all he could do was lie silent and watch.
“Snooper” was now within a couple of feet
of the body which lay with right hand outstretched,
a ring upon the third finger.</p>

<p class='c013'>With ghoulish greed Jones covered the short
intervening distance and with a quick snatch
reached out for the ring.</p>

<p class='c013'>Even the German sniper hidden in the
bushes gave a startled utterance of astonishment
at the suddenness of what happened.</p>

<p class='c013'>The body of “Snooper” Jones, shooting
forth sharp streaks of bluish flame, was lifted
two feet into the air, and then dropped back
a scorched and withered and motionless mass.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Snooper” Jones had paid the death penalty!</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_6_0_65 c012'>AND now, as the days passed and the
fighting settled down to more of a
desultory routine than it had been in
the earlier stages of the terrific struggle, these
men who had earned a new glory for the
United States and American arms began to
get a new perspective on what it was they
had accomplished in squeezing that big bulge
out of the enemy line. For the first time
since the drive began they had opportunity
to take account of stock, as it were, and to
realize what it was they had done in administering
ignominious defeat to these supposedly
crack troops of the Kaiser—troops that had
rested and trained over a long period while
holding the St. Mihiel salient as a constant
menace over all that section of France immediately
beyond.</p>

<p class='c013'>What was it that these Americans had
accomplished? They had set the tide of war
against the Hun hordes—started them upon
the retreat which ended in defeat and disaster,
and thus began the ending of the worst war
in all human history.</p>

<p class='c013'>Within the second day of the big drive
the Americans had taken Thiaucourt, Thillet,
Hattonville, Herbeville, St. Benoit, Jaulny,
Vieville and Xammes, and Boche prisoners
to the number of more than 15,000. As a
matter of fact the German character is such
that he is only courageous when victorious,
only daring when fighting in excessively
superior numbers, and optimistic only so long
as fortune smiles upon his side. Let the conditions
be reversed and his courage turns to
cowardice, his daring becomes cringing fear,
and surrender and safety become his dominant
thoughts.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus it was as the Americans pushed on,
overcoming all obstacles, fighting and conquering,
even against great odds and under the
most severe handicaps. The Germans, once
realizing the invincibility and the determination
of the armies in pursuit of them, lost
their vaunted courage, ignored orders, cried
“Kamarad! Kamarad!” in treacherous beseeching
for mercy, throwing themselves upon
the very principle of humanity which they
had defied and attempted to destroy.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nor had the boys themselves come through
the terrible battle and their own harrowing
experiences entirely unscathed. Tom, who
had escaped wounds, was now bewailing the
misfortune which had led him, crawling, one
day during the attack, through a clump of
weeds which had badly poisoned the left hand
and arm. He had had two days under a
surgeon’s treatment, and though on the way
to speedy recovery, still had the damaged
member swathed in drug-soaked bandages.</p>

<p class='c013'>George Harper could tell what it felt like
when a bullet cut its way across his scalp,
just a fraction of an inch above the point
where it would have meant his instant death.
As Ollie put it, George had established a new
style of coiffure for the army, parting his hair
across, in the direction from ear to ear.</p>

<p class='c013'>Ollie’s own optimism, however, was often
strained as his face twitched with the pain
from a badly sprained ankle which compelled
him still to hobble around with a cane.
And Ollie could trace his own pain and discomfort
directly to a German, although the
latter paid the worst penalty in the scrimmage,
which involved the Hun, Ollie and a
Frenchman who had come upon the scene in
time to participate in the conclusion of the
hostilities.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was one of those personal encounters
which were so frequent in the fighting in
the woods. Ollie had come face to face with
a Boche nearly twice his size in a thick clump
of trees whose heavy foliage made the place
almost as dark as night in mid-day. The
German was out of ammunition, but evidently
having heard or seen the young American
approaching, he had the butt of his rifle
posed for a crashing blow over Ollie’s scalp
when that wide-awake youth realized his
position and the necessity for instant action.
It was too late to retreat, and he had lost
his own gun ten minutes before and also
was without bullets for his revolver.</p>

<p class='c013'>He dodged, just as the gun descended, and
as the heavy butt of the rifle came down upon
his shoulders he grabbed the German by the
legs and upset him. But Ollie also went down
at the same time, and under the weight of
the massive Boche. He wriggled free and
had partially arisen when the German again
threw his more than two hundred pounds of
avoirdupois upon him. The force of the impact
was such that something had to give
way, and it was the ankle upon which most
of the load came. In the excitement of the
moment Ollie did not even feel a twinge of
pain, for it was a life and death struggle, with
all the odds in favor of the German. It was
just at that moment that the Frenchman put
in his appearance. With a glitter in his eyes
that seemed to reflect all the stored-up wrath
and hatred of France against the German
race, the poilu raised his gun, butt-end first,
just as the German had done when Ollie
came upon him. But this time it was the
German who was the intended victim, and he
could not escape while the youthful American
retained his iron grasp around his knees.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was all over in an instant, but when
Ollie tried to rise his left leg caved under
him. The Frenchman gave him a helping
hand, but even when he was upon his feet
he could not walk, could not even touch his
left foot to the ground, while the jar and shock
of trying to hop sent excruciating pains shooting
all the way to his hip.</p>

<p class='c013'>So the Frenchman, who was not very tall,
but extremely broad of shoulder—a man
who had been a hard-working, peaceful farmer
until the barbarous German armed mobs had
come coursing over neutral Belgium and into
France—had taken him upon his back and
had carried him for more than half a mile to
the nearest first-aid station.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus it was that all three lads, although
able to be moving around, were on the sick
list and were called upon, if at all, only for
the lightest duties. And so it was, also, that
when the great summing up came—the casting
of the total, so to speak—when every
agency that had been brought to bear or
had participated in the campaign was taken
into the accounting, the three lads were
brought into that semi-clerical, altogether
pleasant and highly informative task.</p>

<p class='c013'>It afforded them an entirely new impression
of the magnitude of a single big battle in
war, when they learned something of what had
taken place in that now historic St. Mihiel
Drive, of which they were themselves no
small or unimportant part.</p>

<p class='c013'>All had seen the vast telephone system in
operation, a system which was changed and
extended and contracted almost hourly as
the tide of battle swung back and forth and
the advance steadily continued. Nevertheless
it was in the nature of a revelation to
know that no less than ten thousand men had
been engaged in operating it. And supplementing
all this, a silent corps of three
thousand carrier pigeons had flown back and
forth, faithful and often martyred servants in
the great cause of humanity, fulfilling their
duty unquestioningly, unerringly with that
rare sense of direction which man has never
fathomed.</p>

<p class='c013'>More than six thousand telephone instruments
were connected up to five thousand
miles of wire in the system already mentioned,
and together with the pigeon service supplementing
it, it afforded a service rivalling that
of many fair-sized cities.</p>

<p class='c013'>Ollie Ogden, going through the figures set
forth in one set of reports, uttered an involuntary
ejaculation as his total correctly showed
that during the drive four thousand, eight
hundred motor trucks had carried food, men
and munitions into the lines. And in addition
to this, miles of American railroad, both
standard and narrow gauge, carrying American-made
equipment, assisted in the transportation
of men and supplies throughout the
period of advancing conquest.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of the more than one hundred thousand
detailed maps, together with some forty
thousand photographs, completely showing
every foot of the ground over which the battle
was to be fought, the youths knew before the
drive was fully launched. But significant as
these facts were of the scope and thoroughness
with which the battle was to be carried
out, they were not prepared for the proofs of
American efficiency which their present duties
brought before them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Apparently no contingency was overlooked,
and it was this care in preparation which
figured so largely in the sustained drive
which utterly routed the theretofore self-confident
Germans.</p>

<p class='c013'>The hospital facilities that were provided
for the care of the sick and wounded included
thirty-five complete hospital trains, with no
less than sixteen thousand beds in the advanced,
or almost front line, sector, and
fifty-five thousand such additional beds behind
the lines. That not more than ten per
cent of them ever had to be used was a matter
of natural gratification and another proof of
the expert strategy which directed every mile
of the advance. Nevertheless the preparations
had been made, in the event that they
were needed, and this sort of leadership served
but to strengthen the confidence and determination
of the American fighting forces.</p>

<p class='c013'>During every daylight hour that the battles
raged, the records as well as the personal
knowledge of the boys showed, the skies
constantly had been swept by squadrons and
fleets of aeroplanes, preventing aerial observations
by the enemy, attacking the moving
infantry, artillery and supply trains of the
retreating Germans, and at the same time
most effectively directing the fire of the
American artillery, with the most devastating
effects upon the demoralized Hun forces.</p>

<p class='c013'>In all a total of one hundred and fifty-two
square miles of French territory, and seventy-two
villages, which the Germans had held for
four years, were captured outright in the drive,
and for the reduction of the German defenses
which they had thought impregnable, and
for the creeping barrage which almost invariably
preceded the doughboys in their
attacks, more than a million and a half shells
were fired by the American artillery, making
the territory being traversed by the fleeing
Germans a great charnel country of death
and destruction.</p>

<p class='c013'>With a remarkably small casualty list to
themselves, everything considered, the American
forces took no less than sixteen thousand
prisoners, which was only a small proportion
of those annihilated in the merciless advance,
and to this conquest of territory and men they
added the taking of one hundred and eleven
guns, many of them of large calibre and great
distance range, and great stores of munitions
and supplies which the Boches had not time
even to destroy in their headlong flight back
toward the Rhine.</p>

<p class='c013'>But most significant of all, as Tom with
pride of his country pointed out, as the boys
in the approach of evening got together to
compare notes, was the confidence displayed
in advance that all of this would take place,
exactly as it had been planned and according
to scheduled time and program.</p>

<p class='c013'>And that it all had been expected, counted
upon, taken for granted as practically assured
before the first gun was fired, was evidenced
by the fact that every arrangement was made
for the use that was made of more than ten
thousand feet of moving picture film, actually
portraying the Germans in their disorganization
which speedily grew to a rout and presaged
their early and certain defeat in a war
which they had precipitated upon the whole
world and practically all civilization.</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c012'>HAVE
you heard the news?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Buck Granger came bursting
into a little group of men which
included Sergeant Tom Walton, George Harper
and two or three others.</p>

<p class='c013'>News! It is the great thing for which an
army looks and watches and waits. News of
a campaign to be launched, of an attack to
be expected, of the men who have been in
hospital or are missing, of the things that
are going on back home where every soldier
himself wants to be. News! The word
always makes men forget their aches, their
pains, their gossip or chatter to hear it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What news?” demanded George Harper.
“We haven’t heard it. What is it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Germans are asking for an armistice.
Austria has already followed the example of
the other German allies, set first by Bulgaria,
and now Germany practically admits herself
defeated and is suing for time in which to
determine terms of peace.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What!” a couple of men ejaculated in
unison. “Where did you hear that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“From a Frenchman and an American
half a mile below, who have just returned
from Paris,” Granger explained, as breathlessly
excited as were his listeners. “It’s gospel,
too, for I heard the men repeat it to a
captain and a major.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, that means the ending of the war,
with complete victory for the Allies,” put in
Sergeant Tom.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hooray!” shouted another, unable longer
to control his enthusiasm, “and that means
that we’ll soon be starting home to the good
old U. S. A.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Like wildfire the news spread throughout
the camp, and apparently it soon was confirmed
from more authoritative quarters, for
the officers themselves seemed lifted to a new
sphere of happiness, and made no effort to
keep down the jubilation which now ran
high among the men.</p>

<p class='c013'>Ollie Ogden, coming past one of the branch
telephone posts, responded to a mysterious
beckoning of a friend in the Signal Corps.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Heard it?” that young man asked, in
lowered tones.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No; what?” was Ollie’s reply and query.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was drawn aside, and for two or three
moments he lent willing ear to the whispered
words of the other man. His face was a
marvel in changing expressions, but as he
turned a questioning look upon the Signal
Corps man, the latter concluded with, “It’s
absolutely true; I got the message myself.
The date’s set for November 11th, and this,
if you’ll recall, is mighty near that date.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Ollie waited for no more, but hurried along
to where he knew he would find Tom and
Harper. He was surprised to find that apparently
everyone else knew of the reported
request of the Germans for an armistice, but
it was left to him to be the bearer of the
information that the request had been agreed
to, under certain stipulations, and that, tentatively
at least, November 11th was the day
that had been agreed upon for the suspension
of hostilities.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was in the very height of the further
excitement caused by this confirmatory news,
that a messenger arrived to say that the
three lads, together with one or two others,
were wanted at brigade headquarters.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What for?” George Harper asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I have my own suspicions it’s not for
anything unpleasant,” the messenger replied
with a knowing grin, “but at the same time
it’s not for me to say or begin predicting, and
if I were you I’d hustle right along without
asking any more questions.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The advice was good in that the lads could
do naught else, and there evidently was
nothing to be gained by interrogating the
other fellow further. So in ten minutes they
were at brigade headquarters, while several
companies stood at attention and a stern
looking French major-general stepped forth
before the men who had been summoned from
several different units.</p>

<p class='c013'>The purpose almost instantly was made
clear, and Tom Walton, at one end of the
line, was the first to receive a French decoration.
Although all of the men had heard
much about such proceedings, they were not
entirely prepared for what happened immediately
after the general, without a word
or other sign, had pinned the emblem upon
Tom Walton’s blouse.</p>

<p class='c013'>The soldier of France grasped the American
sergeant by the shoulders, firmly planted a
kiss upon his right cheek, then turned him
slightly and for the edification of all the onlookers,
repeated the process upon the left.</p>

<p class='c013'>And thus, to the suppressed amusement of
the scores of men who witnessed the ceremony,
and to the consternation and confusion of the
young men who were the principals in it,
the award of honors and the accompanying
osculatory salutations continued, until every
one of those who had been summoned there
had received the badge of his valor, together
with the embrace and kisses upon the cheek
which are a part of the French custom of
such recognition of deeds of sacrifice and
heroism.</p>

<p class='c013'>As speedily as they could, when the ceremony
was over, Tom, George and Ollie
headed back to where the men of Company
C were gathered; but not yet was the work
of the day concluded.</p>

<p class='c013'>Their captain had been seeking them, and
to him they were bound at once to report.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I congratulate you,” he said, as the
youths appeared before him, “for not only
have you today received the Distinguished
Service Cross from the French Government,
and well earned them, too, but the higher
command of your own army has also
recognized the value of your services, in
promotions which the colonel has just certified
to me.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sergeant Thomas Walton you are henceforth
a second lieutenant in the United
States army, and I herewith hand you your
commission duly signed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Before Tom even could give utterance to
the surprise and gratification which for the
moment overwhelmed him, the captain had
turned to the other two boys.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We may be upon the verge of peace,” he
said, “and yet again one never can tell what
the next hour will bring forth in war. But
whatever occurs, whether hostilities be continued
or suspended, both of you are advanced
to positions of sergeant—and in
announcing these advancements or promotions
I am proud to say that they were hard
won and are well deserved, and that I wish
you three young men the greatest of happiness
and the very best of luck.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The world war was about at an end. The
three boys from Brighton had been tried and
found capable in every task that had been
placed before them.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
